# Strings

[Reference guide: Python concepts from module 3](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oV8kEVwJW_qYR9yeGxHegsE2TBZrCtNJ71ScyMu8JFo/template/preview?resourcekey=0-VHG81a_2c9P0wYVNmrY92g)

Strings are immutable.

## Indices

An **index** is a number assigned to every element in a sequence that indicates its position. With strings, this means each character in the string has its own index.

## Bracket notation

**Bracket notation** refers to the indices placed in square brackets.

```py
device_id = "h32rb17"
print("h32rb17"[0])
print(device_id[0])
print(device_id[-7])
print(device_id[-6])
print("h32rb17"[0:3])

# h
# h
# h
# 3
# h32
```

## String functions and methods

### `str()` and `len()`

```py
device_id_length = len("h32rb17")
if device_id_length == 7:
    print("The device ID has 7 characters.")
```

### `.upper()` and `.lower() `

```py
print("Information Technology".upper())
# INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY
```

### `.index()`

```py
# if a string contains more than one instance of a character, only the first one will be returned.
print("h32rb1r7".index("r"))
# 3
```

### Finding substrings with `.index()`

```py
tshah_index = "tsnow, tshah, bmoreno - updated".index("tshah")
print(tshah_index)
# 7
```

### Extract the website name

```py
# Assign `url` to a specific URL
url = "https://exampleURL1.com"
# Assign `ind` to the output of applying `.index()` to `url` in order to extract the starting index of ".com" in `url`
ind = url.index(".com")
# Extract the website name in `url` and display it
print(url[8:ind])
print(url[8:-4])

# exampleURL1
# exampleURL1
```

# Lists

## Changing the elements in a list

```py
username_list = ["elarson", "fgarcia", "tshah", "sgilmore"]
print("Before changing an element:", username_list)
username_list[1] = "bmoreno"
print("After changing an element:", username_list)
```

## List methods

### `.insert() `

```py
username_list = ["elarson", "bmoreno", "tshah", "sgilmore"]
print("Before inserting an element:", username_list)
username_list.insert(2,"wjaffrey")
print("After inserting an element:", username_list)

# Before inserting an element: ['elarson', 'bmoreno', 'tshah', 'sgilmore']
# After inserting an element: ['elarson', 'bmoreno', 'wjaffrey', 'tshah', 'sgilmore']
```

### `.remove()`

```py
username_list = ["elarson", "bmoreno", "wjaffrey", "tshah", "sgilmore"]
print("Before removing an element:", username_list)
username_list.remove("elarson")
print("After removing an element:", username_list)

# Before removing an element: ['elarson', 'bmoreno', 'wjaffrey', 'tshah', 'sgilmore']
# After removing an element: ['bmoreno', 'wjaffrey', 'tshah', 'sgilmore']
```

### `.append()`

```py
username_list = ["bmoreno", "wjaffrey", "tshah", "sgilmore"]
print("Before appending an element:", username_list)
username_list.append("btang")
print("After appending an element:", username_list)

# Before appending an element: ['bmoreno', 'wjaffrey', 'tshah', 'sgilmore']
# After appending an element: ['bmoreno', 'wjaffrey', 'tshah', 'sgilmore', 'btang']


numbers_list = []
print("Before appending a sequence of numbers:", numbers_list)
for i in range(10):
    numbers_list.append(i)
print("After appending a sequence of numbers:", numbers_list)

# Before appending a sequence of numbers: []
# After appending a sequence of numbers: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
```

### `.index()`

```py
username_list = ["bmoreno", "wjaffrey", "tshah", "sgilmore", "btang"]
username_index = username_list.index("tshah")
print(username_index)

# 2
```

## Function to automate the login process

```py
# Assign `approved_users` to a list of approved usernames
approved_users = ["elarson", "bmoreno", "sgilmore", "eraab", "gesparza"]

# Assign `approved_devices` to a list of device IDs that correspond to the usernames in `approved_users`
approved_devices = ["8rp2k75", "hl0s5o1", "4n482ts", "a307vir", "3rcv4w6"]

def login(username, device_id):
    if username in approved_users:
        print("The user", username, "is approved to access the system.")
        ind = approved_users.index(username)
        if device_id == approved_devices[ind]:
          print(device_id, "is the assigned device for", username)
        else:
          print(device_id, "is not their assigned device.")
    else:
        print("The username", username, "is not approved to access the system.")

login("bmoreno", "hl0s5o1")
login("elarson", "r2s5r9g")
login("abernard", "4n482ts")

# The user bmoreno is approved to access the system.
# hl0s5o1 is the assigned device for bmoreno
# The user elarson is approved to access the system.
# r2s5r9g is not their assigned device.
# The username abernard is not approved to access the system.
```

# Regular expressions

```py
import re
re.findall("ts", "tsnow, tshah, bmoreno")
# ['ts', 'ts']
```

## Symbols for character types

```py
import re
re.findall("\w", "h32rb17")
# ['h', '3', '2', 'r', 'b', '1', '7']

re.findall("\d", "h32rb17")
# ['3', '2', '1', '7']

re.findall("\d+", "h32rb17")
# ['32', '17']

re.findall("\d*", "h32rb17")
# ['', '32', '', '', '17', '']

re.findall("\d{2}", "h32rb17 k825t0m c2994eh")
# ['32', '17', '82', '29', '94']

re.findall("\d{1,3}", "h32rb17 k825t0m c2994eh")
# ['32', '17', '825', '0', '299', '4']
```

- `\w` symbol matches with any alphanumeric character
- `\w` symbol also matches with the underscore (`_`)
- `.` matches to all characters, including symbols
- `\d` matches to all single digits [0-9]
- `\s` matches to all single spaces
- `\.` matches to the period character
- `+` symbol represents one or more occurrences of a specific character
- `*` symbol represents zero, one, or more occurrences of a specific character
- If you want to indicate a specific number of repetitions to allow, you can place this number in curly brackets (`{ }`) after the character or symbol.

## Constructing a pattern

`employee_logins_string = "1001 bmoreno: 12 Marketing 1002 tshah: 7 Human Resources 1003 sgilmore: 5 Finance"`

```py
import re
pattern = "\w+:\s\d+"
employee_logins_string = "1001 bmoreno: 12 Marketing 1002 tshah: 7 Human Resources 1003 sgilmore: 5 Finance"
print(re.findall(pattern, employee_logins_string))

# ['bmoreno: 12', 'tshah: 7', 'sgilmore: 5']
```

## Find the device IDs that start with "r15" and display the results

```py
devices = "r262c36 67bv8fy 41j1u2e r151dm4 1270t3o 42dr56i r15xk9h 2j33krk 253be78 ac742a1 r15u9q5 zh86b2l ii286fq 9x482kt 6oa6m6u x3463ac i4l56nq g07h55q 081qc9t r159r1u"
target_pattern = "r15\w+"
print(re.findall(target_pattern, devices))

# ['r151dm4', 'r15xk9h', 'r15u9q5', 'r159r1u']
```

## Extract the IP addresses of the form xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx and display the results
