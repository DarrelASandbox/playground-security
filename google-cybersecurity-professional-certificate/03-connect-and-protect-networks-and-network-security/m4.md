# Brute force attacks and OS hardening

## Patch update

A software and operating system update that addresses security vulnerabilities within a program or product.

## Baseline configuration (baseline image)

A documented set of specifications within a system that is used as a basis for future builds, releases, and updates.

## Brute force attacks

A brute force attack is a trial-and-error process of discovering private information. There are different types of brute force attacks that malicious actors use to guess passwords, including:

- Simple brute force attacks. When attackers try to guess a user's login credentials, it’s considered a simple brute force attack. They might do this by entering any combination of usernames and passwords that they can think of until they find the one that works.
- Dictionary attacks use a similar technique. In dictionary attacks, attackers use a list of commonly used passwords and stolen credentials from previous breaches to access a system. These are called “dictionary” attacks because attackers originally used a list of words from the dictionary to guess the passwords, before complex password rules became a common security practice.

Using brute force to access a system can be a tedious and time consuming process, especially when it’s done manually. There are a range of tools attackers use to conduct their attacks.

## Assessing vulnerabilities

Before a brute force attack or other cybersecurity incident occurs, companies can run a series of tests on their network or web applications to assess vulnerabilities. Analysts can use virtual machines and sandboxes to test suspicious files, check for vulnerabilities before an event occurs, or to simulate a cybersecurity incident.

### Virtual machines (VMs)

Virtual machines (VMs) are software versions of physical computers. VMs provide an additional layer of security for an organization because they can be used to run code in an isolated environment, preventing malicious code from affecting the rest of the computer or system. VMs can also be deleted and replaced by a pristine image after testing malware.

VMs are useful when investigating potentially infected machines or running malware in a constrained environment. Using a VM may prevent damage to your system in the event its tools are used improperly. VMs also give you the ability to revert to a previous state. However, there are still some risks involved with VMs. There’s still a small risk that a malicious program can escape virtualization and access the host machine.

You can test and explore applications easily with VMs, and it’s easy to switch between different VMs from your computer. This can also help in streamlining many security tasks.

### Sandbox environments

A sandbox is a type of testing environment that allows you to execute software or programs separate from your network. They are commonly used for testing patches, identifying and addressing bugs, or detecting cybersecurity vulnerabilities. Sandboxes can also be used to evaluate suspicious software, evaluate files containing malicious code, and simulate attack scenarios.

Sandboxes can be stand-alone physical computers that are not connected to a network; however, it is often more time- and cost-effective to use software or cloud-based virtual machines as sandbox environments. Note that some malware authors know how to write code to detect if the malware is executed in a VM or sandbox environment. Attackers can program their malware to behave as harmless software when run inside these types of testing environments.
Prevention measures

Some common measures organizations use to prevent brute force attacks and similar attacks from occurring include:

- **Salting and hashing**: Hashing converts information into a unique value that can then be used to determine its integrity. It is a one-way function, meaning it is impossible to decrypt and obtain the original text. Salting adds random characters to hashed passwords. This increases the length and complexity of hash values, making them more secure.
- **Multi-factor authentication (MFA) and two-factor authentication (2FA)**: MFA is a security measure which requires a user to verify their identity in two or more ways to access a system or network. This verification happens using a combination of authentication factors: a username and password, fingerprints, facial recognition, or a one-time password (OTP) sent to a phone number or email. 2FA is similar to MFA, except it uses only two forms of verification.
- **CAPTCHA and reCAPTCHA**: CAPTCHA stands for Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart. It asks users to complete a simple test that proves they are human. This helps prevent software from trying to brute force a password. reCAPTCHA is a free CAPTCHA service from Google that helps protect websites from bots and malicious software.
- **Password policies**: Organizations use password policies to standardize good password practices throughout the business. Policies can include guidelines on how complex a password should be, how often users need to update passwords, whether passwords can be reused or not, and if there are limits to how many times a user can attempt to log in before their account is suspended.

# Apply OS hardening techniques

## Activity Overview

In this activity, you will take on the role of a cybersecurity analyst working for a company that hosts the cooking website, yummyrecipesforme.com. Visitors to the website experience a security issue when loading the main webpage. Your job is to investigate, identify, document, and recommend a solution to the security problem.

When investigating the security event, you will review a tcpdump log. You will need to identify the network protocols used to establish the connection between the user and the website. Network protocols are the communication rules and standards networked devices use to transmit data. Unfortunately, malicious actors can also use network protocols to invade and attack private networks. Knowing how to identify the protocols commonly used in attacks will help you protect your organization’s network against these types of security events.

To complete the assignment, you will also need to document what occurred during the security incident. Then, you will recommend one security measure to implement to prevent similar security problems in the future.

Be sure to complete this activity before moving on. The next course item will provide you with a completed exemplar to compare to your own work.

## Scenario

Review the scenario below. Then complete the step-by-step instructions.

You are a cybersecurity analyst for yummyrecipesforme.com, a website that sells recipes and cookbooks. A former employee has decided to lure users to a fake website with malware.

The former employee/ hacker executed a brute force attack to gain access to the web host. They repeatedly entered several known default passwords for the administrative account until they correctly guessed the right one. After they obtained the login credentials, they were able to access the admin panel and change the website’s source code. They embedded a javascript function in the source code that prompted visitors to download and run a file upon visiting the website. After embedding the malware, the hacker changed the password to the administrative account. When customers download the file, they are redirected to a fake version of the website that contains the malware.

Several hours after the attack, multiple customers emailed yummyrecipesforme’s helpdesk. They complained that the company’s website had prompted them to download a file to access free recipes. The customers claimed that, after running the file, the address of the website changed and their personal computers began running more slowly.

In response to this incident, the website owner tries to log in to the admin panel but is unable to, so they reach out to the website hosting provider. You and other cybersecurity analysts are tasked with investigating this security event.

To address the incident, you create a sandbox environment to observe the suspicious website behavior. You run the network protocol analyzer tcpdump, then type in the URL for the website, yummyrecipesforme.com. As soon as the website loads, you are prompted to download an executable file to update your browser. You accept the download and allow the file to run. You then observe that your browser redirects you to a different URL, greatrecipesforme.com, which contains the malware.

The logs show the following process:

1. The browser initiates a DNS request: It requests the IP address of the yummyrecipesforme.com URL from the DNS server.
2. The DNS replies with the correct IP address.
3. The browser initiates an HTTP request: It requests the yummyrecipesforme.com webpage using the IP address sent by the DNS server.
4. The browser initiates the download of the malware.
5. The browser initiates a DNS request for greatrecipesforme.com.
6. The DNS server responds with the IP address for greatrecipesforme.com.
7. The browser initiates an HTTP request to the IP address for greatrecipesforme.com.

A senior analyst confirms that the website was compromised. The analyst checks the source code for the website. They notice that javascript code had been added to prompt website visitors to download an executable file. Analysis of the downloaded file found a script that redirects the visitors’ browsers from yummyrecipesforme.com to greatrecipesforme.com.

The cybersecurity team reports that the web server was impacted by a brute force attack. The disgruntled hacker was able to guess the password easily because the admin password was still set to the default password. Additionally, there were no controls in place to prevent a brute force attack.

Your job is to document the incident in detail, including identifying the network protocols used to establish the connection between the user and the website. You should also recommend a security action to take to prevent brute force attacks in the future.

Link to template: [Security incident report template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bmTZQGiYdJSgwQ08IpXWEUWhnKMVbJ2KZxsheZhzMMs/template/preview)

### Step 2: Access supporting materials

The following supporting materials will help you complete this activity. Keep them open as you proceed to the next steps.

To use the supporting materials for this course item, click the link below and select Use Template.

Links to supporting materials:

- [tcpdump traffic log](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HDAQTLSK5CyPLPHeLI0s75kNE-kA2kG0NFJoZlz0xCc/template/preview?resourcekey=0-vDSHnW4qKxOOQtsZeGRUeQ)
- [How to read the tcpdump log](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zuVm_KixJqoHxrMefsxG0bi1tB6RYBQsXkPHIWxdRag/template/preview#heading=h.shz1bcdh2tm3)

### Step 3: Identify the network protocol involved in the incident

As one of the cybersecurity analysts in this scenario, you are tasked with writing an incident report for this security event. Using the tcpdump log file, determine which network protocol is identified in the packet captures during the investigation. You will use what you learned about the four layers of the TCP/IP model and which protocols happen at each layer. If needed, you can review [the video]() and [reading about the TCP/IP model]() to use as guides for your response. Then review the tcpdump traffic log and record which protocol you identified in the first section of the security incident report template.

### Step 4: Document the incident

Summarize the incident in the second section of the report. Provide as many details and facts as possible in your documentation. When writing the documentation, be sure to:

- Avoid using strong emotional language (good, terrible, awful, etc.).
- Include as many facts about the issue as you can, including where the incident occurred, how it happened, whether anyone witnessed it, how it was discovered, etc.
- Indicate your sources for information and evidence.

Writing accurate and detailed documentation for cybersecurity incidents can serve as a reference point for other cybersecurity analysts. Additionally, quality documentation can be used to educate other employees about cybersecurity measures taken within the company when incidents occur and can help businesses comply with various security audits.

### Step 5: Recommend one remediation for brute force attacks

After documenting the incident, write one recommendation to help your organization prevent brute force attacks in the future.

Some of the common security methods used to prevent brute force attacks include:

- Requiring strong passwords
- Enforcing two-factor authentication (2FA)
- Monitoring login attempts
- Requiring more frequent password changes
- Disallowing previous passwords from being used
- Limiting the number of login attempts

Select one security measure, and explain why it is effective in section three of the security incident report template.

The more safety measures that are in place, the less likely a malicious actor will be able to access sensitive information.

### Pro tip: Save the template

Finally, be sure to save a blank copy of the template you used to complete this activity. You can use it for further practice or in your professional projects. These templates will help you work through your thought processes and demonstrate your experience to potential employers.

### What to Include in Your Response

- Compare the exemplar to your completed activity. Review your work using each of the criteria in the exemplar. What did you do well? Where can you improve? Use your answers to these questions to guide you as you continue to progress through the course.

**Note**: The exemplar represents one possible explanation for the issues that the end users are facing. Yours will likely differ in certain ways. What’s important is that you identified the network protocols involved and created a report. In your role as a security analyst, you and your team would document any issue that occurs on the network and come up with solutions to help prevent the same issues from occurring in the future. Good quality documentation can save you and your organization time and potentially manage the attack early on.

First, analyze the DNS & HTTP traffic log to identify a network protocol. Then, document the cybersecurity incident. Finally, recommend one security measure your organization could implement to prevent brute force attacks in the future. Creating this process will, in turn, help improve the organization’s security posture.

The exemplar is accompanied by the activity, and presents a professional documentation example to include the following:

- One network protocol identified during the investigation
- Documentation of the incident
- A recommended security measure

# Network security applications

This section of the course covers the topic of network hardening and monitoring. Each device, tool, or security strategy put in place by security analysts further protects—or hardens—the network until the network owner is satisfied with the level of security. This approach of adding layers of security to a network is referred to as defense in depth.

In this reading, you are going to learn about the role of four devices used to secure a network—firewalls, intrusion detection systems, intrusion prevention systems, and security incident and event management tools. Network security professionals have the choice to use any or all of these devices and tools depending on the level of security that they hope to achieve.

This reading will discuss the benefits of layered security. Each tool mentioned is an additional layer of defense that can incrementally harden a network, starting with the minimum level of security (provided by just a firewall), to the highest level of security (provided by combining a firewall, an intrusion detection and prevention device, and security event monitoring).

![layered-security](/google-cybersecurity-professional-certificate/03-connect-and-protect-networks-and-network-security/assets/layered-security.png)

Take note of where each tool is located on the network. Each tool has its own place in the network’s architecture. Security analysts are required to understand the network topologies shown in the diagrams throughout this reading.

## Firewall

So far in this course, you learned about stateless firewalls, stateful firewalls, and next-generation firewalls (NGFWs), and the security advantages of each of them.

Most firewalls are similar in their basic functions. Firewalls allow or block traffic based on a set of rules. As data packets enter a network, the packet header is inspected and allowed or denied based on its port number. NGFWs are also able to inspect packet payloads. Each system should have its own firewall, regardless of the network firewall.

## Intrusion Detection System

An **intrusion detection system (IDS)** is an application that monitors system activity and alerts on possible intrusions. An IDS alerts administrators based on the signature of malicious traffic.

The IDS is configured to detect known attacks. IDS systems often sniff data packets as they move across the network and analyze them for the characteristics of known attacks. Some IDS systems review not only for signatures of known attacks, but also for anomalies that could be the sign of malicious activity. When the IDS discovers an anomaly, it sends an alert to the network administrator who can then investigate further.

The limitations to IDS systems are that they can only scan for known attacks or obvious anomalies. New and sophisticated attacks might not be caught. The other limitation is that the IDS doesn’t actually stop the incoming traffic if it detects something awry. It’s up to the network administrator to catch the malicious activity before it does anything damaging to the network.
An IDS circled above an image of a switch, which rests between a firewall and the network.

When combined with a firewall, an IDS adds another layer of defense. The IDS is placed behind the firewall and before entering the LAN, which allows the IDS to analyze data streams after network traffic that is disallowed by the firewall has been filtered out. This is done to reduce noise in IDS alerts, also referred to as false positives.

## Intrusion Prevention System

An **intrusion prevention system (IPS)** is an application that monitors system activity for intrusive activity and takes action to stop the activity. It offers even more protection than an IDS because it actively stops anomalies when they are detected, unlike the IDS that simply reports the anomaly to a network administrator.

An IPS searches for signatures of known attacks and data anomalies. An IPS reports the anomaly to security analysts and blocks a specific sender or drops network packets that seem suspect.

The IPS (like an IDS) sits behind the firewall in the network architecture. This offers a high level of security because risky data streams are disrupted before they even reach sensitive parts of the network. However, one potential limitation is that it is inline: If it breaks, the connection between the private network and the internet breaks. Another limitation of IPS is the possibility of false positives, which can result in legitimate traffic getting dropped.

## Full packet capture devices

Full packet capture devices can be incredibly useful for network administrators and security professionals. These devices allow you to record and analyze all of the data that is transmitted over your network. They also aid in investigating alerts created by an IDS.

## Security Information and Event Management

A **security information and event management system (SIEM)** is an application that collects and analyzes log data to monitor critical activities in an organization. SIEM tools work in real time to report suspicious activity in a centralized dashboard. SIEM tools additionally analyze network log data sourced from IDSs, IPSs, firewalls, VPNs, proxies, and DNS logs. SIEM tools are a way to aggregate security event data so that it all appears in one place for security analysts to analyze. This is referred to as a single pane of glass.

Below, you can review an example of a dashboard from Google Cloud’s SIEM tool, Chronicle. **Chronicle** is a cloud-native tool designed to retain, analyze, and search data.

**Splunk** is another common SIEM tool. Splunk offers different SIEM tool options: Splunk Enterprise and Splunk Cloud. Both options include detailed dashboards which help security professionals to review and analyze an organization's data. There are also other similar SIEM tools available, and it's important for security professionals to research the different tools to determine which one is most beneficial to the organization.

A SIEM tool doesn’t replace the expertise of security analysts, or of the network- and system-hardening activities covered in this course, but they’re used in combination with other security methods. Security analysts often work in a Security Operations Center (SOC) where they can monitor the activity across the network. They can then use their expertise and experience to determine how to respond to the information on the dashboard and decide when the events meet the criteria to be escalated to oversight.

# Analysis of network hardening

## Activity Overview

In this activity, you will be presented with a scenario about a social media organization that recently experienced a major data breach caused by undetected vulnerabilities. To address the breach, you will identify some common network hardening tools that can be implemented to protect the organization’s overall security. Then, you will select a specific vulnerability that the company has and propose different network hardening methods. Finally, you will explain how the methods and tools you chose will be effective for managing the vulnerability and how they will prevent potential breaches in the future.

In the course, you learned network hardening and network security-related hardening practices, such as port filtering, network access privileges, and encryption over networks. Network hardening practices help organizations monitor potential threats and attacks on their network and prevent some attacks from occurring. Some hardening practices are implemented every day, while others are executed every once in a while, such as every other week or once a month. Understanding how to use network hardening tools and methods will help you better monitor network activity and protect your organization’s network against various attacks.

Be sure to complete this activity before moving on. The next course item will provide you with a completed exemplar to compare to your own work.

## Scenario

Review the following scenario. Then complete the step-by-step instructions.

You are a security analyst working for a social media organization. The organization recently experienced a major data breach, which compromised the safety of their customers’ personal information, such as names and addresses. Your organization wants to implement strong network hardening practices that can be performed consistently to prevent attacks and breaches in the future.

After inspecting the organization’s network, you discover four major vulnerabilities. The four vulnerabilities are as follows:

1. The organization’s employees' share passwords.
2. The admin password for the database is set to the default.
3. The firewalls do not have rules in place to filter traffic coming in and out of the network.
4. Multifactor authentication (MFA) is not used.

If no action is taken to address these vulnerabilities, the organization is at risk of experiencing another data breach or other attacks in the future.

In this activity, you will write a security risk assessment to analyze the incident and explain what methods can be used to further secure the network.

Finally, be sure to save a blank copy of the template you used to complete this activity. You can use it for further practice or in your professional projects. These templates will help you work through your thought processes and demonstrate your experience to potential employers.

### What to Include in Your Response

Be sure to address the following criteria in your completed activity:

- One to three network hardening tools and methods.
- The reasons why the tools and methods selected are effective.

## Activity Exemplar

- [Security risk assessment report exemplar](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rYHPm3ITr3z5UbqDsOy-laZVGgHYBX0X5K_DzeHMkes/template/preview)

Compare the exemplar to your completed activity. Review your work using each of the criteria in the exemplar. What did you do well? Where can you improve? Use your answers to these questions to guide you as you continue to progress through the course.

**Note**: The exemplar represents one possible explanation for the issues that the social media organization is facing. There are multiple correct security hardening tools and methods to use. What’s important is that you identified the network hardening measures that are most effective for managing the vulnerabilities selected. In your role as a security analyst, you and your team would then explain your decisions and make a case for why those measures will be effective at securing the network.

The exemplar focuses on the vulnerability of an outdated software for an on-premises database. One potential solution to the vulnerability is identified and included in the report for the direct supervisors. The report explains how the company might be compromised in the future if the database is not patched and if employees continue to share passwords.

In the section about the organization’s information security policy, the report includes information about adding general security hardening practices, a recommendation for how often the hardening practices should be performed, and an explanation of what the potential consequences are if the policy is not followed. This is one example of how a security risk assessment report can be analyzed and how an information security policy might be written.

# Secure the cloud

## Cloud security considerations

Many organizations choose to use cloud services because of the ease of deployment, speed of deployment, cost savings, and scalability of these options. Cloud computing presents unique security challenges that cybersecurity analysts need to be aware of.

### Identity access management

**Identity access management (IAM)** is a collection of processes and technologies that helps organizations manage digital identities in their environment. This service also authorizes how users can use different cloud resources. A common problem that organizations face when using the cloud is the loose configuration of cloud user roles. An improperly configured user role increases risk by allowing unauthorized users to have access to critical cloud operations.

### Configuration

The number of available cloud services adds complexity to the network. Each service must be carefully configured to meet security and compliance requirements. This presents a particular challenge when organizations perform an initial migration into the cloud. When this change occurs on their network, they must ensure that every process moved into the cloud has been configured correctly. If network administrators and architects are not meticulous in correctly configuring the organization’s cloud services, they could leave the network open to compromise. Misconfigured cloud services are a common source of cloud security issues.

### Attack surface

Cloud service providers (CSPs) offer numerous applications and services for organizations at a low cost.

Every service or application on a network carries its own set of risks and vulnerabilities and increases an organization’s overall attack surface. An increased attack surface must be compensated for with increased security measures.

Cloud networks that utilize many services introduce lots of entry points into an organization’s network. However, if the network is designed correctly, utilizing several services does not introduce more entry points into an organization’s network design. These entry points can be used to introduce malware onto the network and pose other security vulnerabilities. It is important to note that CSPs often defer to more secure options, and have undergone more scrutiny than a traditional on-premises network.

### Zero-day attacks

Zero-day attacks are an important security consideration for organizations using cloud or traditional on-premise network solutions. A **zero day** attack is an exploit that was previously unknown. CSPs are more likely to know about a zero day attack occurring before a traditional IT organization does. CSPs have ways of patching hypervisors and migrating workloads to other virtual machines. These methods ensure the customers are not impacted by the attack. There are also several tools available for patching at the operating system level that organizations can use.

### Visibility and tracking

Network administrators have access to every data packet crossing the network with both on-premise and cloud networks. They can sniff and inspect data packets to learn about network performance or to check for possible threats and attacks.

This kind of visibility is also offered in the cloud through flow logs and tools, such as packet mirroring. CSPs take responsibility for security in the cloud, but they do not allow the organizations that use their infrastructure to monitor traffic on the CSP’s servers. Many CSPs offer strong security measures to protect their infrastructure. Still, this situation might be a concern for organizations that are accustomed to having full access to their network and operations. CSPs pay for third-party audits to verify how secure a cloud network is and identify potential vulnerabilities. The audits can help organizations identify whether any vulnerabilities originate from on-premise infrastructure and if there are any compliance lapses from their CSP.

### Things change fast in the cloud

CSPs are large organizations that work hard to stay up-to-date with technology advancements. For organizations that are used to being in control of any adjustments made to their network, this can be a potential challenge to keep up with. Cloud service updates can affect security considerations for the organizations using them. For example, connection configurations might need to be changed based on the CSP’s updates.

Organizations that use CSPs usually have to update their IT processes. It is possible for organizations to continue following established best practices for changes, configurations, and other security considerations. However, an organization might have to adopt a different approach in a way that aligns with changes made by the CSP.

Cloud networking offers various options that might appear attractive to a small company—options that they could never afford to build on their own premises. However, it is important to consider that each service adds complexity to the security profile of the organization, and they will need security personnel to monitor all of the cloud services.

## Shared responsibility model

A commonly accepted cloud security principle is the shared responsibility model. The **shared responsibility model** states that the CSP must take responsibility for security involving the cloud infrastructure, including physical data centers, hypervisors, and host operating systems. The company using the cloud service is responsible for the assets and processes that they store or operate in the cloud.

The shared responsibility model ensures that both the CSP and the users agree about where their responsibility for security begins and ends. A problem occurs when organizations assume that the CSP is taking care of security that they have not taken responsibility for. One example of this is cloud applications and configurations. The CSP takes responsibility for securing the cloud, but it is the organization’s responsibility to ensure that services are configured properly according to the security requirements of their organization.

# Cryptography and cloud security

## Cloud security hardening

There are various techniques and tools that can be used to secure cloud network infrastructure and resources. Some common cloud security hardening techniques include incorporating IAM, hypervisors, baselining, cryptography, and cryptographic erasure.

### Identity access management (IAM)

**Identity access management (IAM)** is a collection of processes and technologies that helps organizations manage digital identities in their environment. This service also authorizes how users can leverage different cloud resources.

### Hypervisors

A **hypervisor** abstracts the host’s hardware from the operating software environment. There are two types of hypervisors. Type one hypervisors run on the hardware of the host computer. An example of a type one hypervisor is VMware®'s ESXi. Type two hypervisors operate on the software of the host computer. An example of a type two hypervisor is VirtualBox. Cloud service providers (CSPs) commonly use type one hypervisors. CSPs are responsible for managing the hypervisor and other virtualization components. The CSP ensures that cloud resources and cloud environments are available, and it provides regular patches and updates. Vulnerabilities in hypervisors or misconfigurations can lead to virtual machine escapes (VM escapes). A VM escape is an exploit where a malicious actor gains access to the primary hypervisor, potentially the host computer and other VMs. As a CSP customer, you will rarely deal with hypervisors directly.

### Baselining

**Baselining** for cloud networks and operations cover how the cloud environment is configured and set up. A baseline is a fixed reference point. This reference point can be used to compare changes made to a cloud environment. Proper configuration and setup can greatly improve the security and performance of a cloud environment. Examples of establishing a baseline in a cloud environment include: restricting access to the admin portal of the cloud environment, enabling password management, enabling file encryption, and enabling threat detection services for SQL databases.

## Cryptography in the cloud

Cryptography can be applied to secure data that is processed and stored in a cloud environment. Cryptography uses encryption and secure key management systems to provide data integrity and confidentiality. Cryptographic encryption is one of the key ways to secure sensitive data and information in the cloud.

Encryption is the process of scrambling information into ciphertext, which is not readable to anyone without the encryption key. Encryption primarily originated from manually encoding messages and information using an algorithm to convert any given letter or number to a new value. Modern encryption relies on the secrecy of a key, rather than the secrecy of an algorithm. Cryptography is an important tool that helps secure cloud networks and data at rest to prevent unauthorized access. You’ll learn more about cryptography in-depth in an upcoming course.

## Cryptographic erasure

Cryptographic erasure is a method of erasing the encryption key for the encrypted data. When destroying data in the cloud, more traditional methods of data destruction are not as effective. Crypto-shredding is a newer technique where the cryptographic keys used for decrypting the data are destroyed. This makes the data undecipherable and prevents anyone from decrypting the data. When crypto-shredding, all copies of the key need to be destroyed so no one has any opportunity to access the data in the future.

## Key Management

Modern encryption relies on keeping the encryption keys secure. Below are the measures you can take to further protect your data when using cloud applications:

- Trusted platform module (TPM). TPM is a computer chip that can securely store passwords, certificates, and encryption keys.
- Cloud hardware security module (CloudHSM). CloudHSM is a computing device that provides secure storage for cryptographic keys and processes cryptographic operations, such as encryption and decryption.

Organizations and customers do not have access to the cloud service provider (CSP) directly, but they can request audits and security reports by contacting the CSP. Customers typically do not have access to the specific encryption keys that CSPs use to encrypt the customers’ data. However, almost all CSPs allow customers to provide their own encryption keys, depending on the service the customer is accessing. In turn, the customer is responsible for their encryption keys and ensuring the keys remain confidential. The CSP is limited in how they can help the customer if the customer’s keys are compromised or destroyed. One key benefit of the shared responsibility model is that the customer is not entirely responsible for maintenance of the cryptographic infrastructure. Organizations can assess and monitor the risk involved with allowing the CSP to manage the infrastructure by reviewing a CSPs audit and security controls. For federal contractors, FEDRAMP provides a list of verified CSPs.

# Use the NIST Cybersecurity Framework to respond to a security incident

## Activity Overview

In this activity, you will create an incident report using the knowledge you’ve gained about networks throughout this course to analyze a network incident. You will analyze the situation using the National Institute of Standards and Technology's Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF). The CSF is a voluntary framework that consists of standards, guidelines, and best practices to manage cybersecurity risk. Creating a quality cybersecurity incident report and applying the CSF can demonstrate a proactive approach to security, improving communication and transparency with stakeholders, and improve security practices within your organization. You can also add the incident report you create to your cybersecurity portfolio when you complete it.

The CSF is scalable and can be applied in a wide variety of contexts. As you continue to learn more and refine your understanding of key cybersecurity skills, you can use the templates provided in this activity in other situations. Knowing how to identify which security measures to apply in response to business needs will help you determine which are the best available options when it comes to network security.

Be sure to complete this activity before moving on. In the next course item, you will be able to self-assess your response. After that, there will be a completed exemplar to compare to your own work. It will also provide an opportunity for you to answer rubric questions that allow you to reflect on key elements of your professional statement.

## Scenario

Review the scenario below. Then complete the step-by-step instructions.

You are a cybersecurity analyst working for a multimedia company that offers web design services, graphic design, and social media marketing solutions to small businesses. Your organization recently experienced a DDoS attack, which compromised the internal network for two hours until it was resolved.

During the attack, your organization’s network services suddenly stopped responding due to an incoming flood of ICMP packets. Normal internal network traffic could not access any network resources. The incident management team responded by blocking incoming ICMP packets, stopping all non-critical network services offline, and restoring critical network services.

The company’s cybersecurity team then investigated the security event. They found that a malicious actor had sent a flood of ICMP pings into the company’s network through an unconfigured firewall. This vulnerability allowed the malicious attacker to overwhelm the company’s network through a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack.

To address this security event, the network security team implemented:

- A new firewall rule to limit the rate of incoming ICMP packets
- Source IP address verification on the firewall to check for spoofed IP addresses on incoming ICMP packets
- Network monitoring software to detect abnormal traffic patterns
- An IDS/IPS system to filter out some ICMP traffic based on suspicious characteristics

As a cybersecurity analyst, you are tasked with using this security event to create a plan to improve your company’s network security, following the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework (CSF). You will use the CSF to help you navigate through the different steps of analyzing this cybersecurity event and integrate your analysis into a general security strategy. We have broken the analysis into different parts in the template below. You can explore them here:

- Identify security risks through regular audits of internal networks, systems, devices, and access privileges to identify potential gaps in security.
- Protect internal assets through the implementation of policies, procedures, training and tools that help mitigate cybersecurity threats.
- Detect potential security incidents and improve monitoring capabilities to increase the speed and efficiency of detections.
- Respond to contain, neutralize, and analyze security incidents; implement improvements to the security process.
- Recover affected systems to normal operation and restore systems data and/or assets that have been affected by an incident.

## Step-By-Step Instructions

Follow the instructions and fill in the sections to complete the activity. Then, go to the next course item to compare your work to a completed exemplar.

### Step 2: Summarize the security event

Using the template provided, provide a summary of the security event that occurred. Include information about the security event, its cause, the impact, and the response. You can also include information about targeted systems, the attack source, and the estimated impact.

### Step 3: Identify the type of attack and the systems affected

Think about all of the concepts covered in the course so far and reflect on the scenario and define what type of attack occurred and which systems were affected. List this information in the incident report analysis worksheet in the section titled “Identify.”

### Step 4: Protect the assets in your organization from being compromised

Next, you will assess where the organization can improve to further protect its assets. In this step, you will focus on creating an immediate action plan to respond to the cybersecurity incident. When creating this plan, reflect on the following question:

- What systems or procedures need to be updated or changed to further secure the organization’s assets?

Write your response in the incident report analysis template in the “Protect” section.

### Step 5: Detect similar incidents in the future

It is important to continuously monitor network traffic on network devices to check for suspicious activity, such as incoming external ICMP packets from non-trusted IP addresses attempting to pass through the organization’s network firewall.

For this step, consider ways you and your team can monitor and analyze network traffic, software applications, track authorized versus unauthorized users, and detect any unusual activity on user accounts. Write your response in the incident response analysis worksheet in the “Detect” section.

### Step 6: Respond to future cybersecurity incidents

After identifying the tools and methods you and your organization have in place for detecting potential vulnerabilities and threats, create a response plan in the event of a future incident. This typically happens after the incident occurred and has been resolved by you and your team. In this case, you will create a response plan for future cybersecurity incidents. Some items to consider when creating a response plan to any cybersecurity incident:

- How can you and your team contain cybersecurity incidents and affected devices?
- What procedures are in place to help you and your team neutralize cybersecurity incidents?
- What data or information can be used to analyze this incident?
- How can your organization’s recovery process be improved to better handle future cybersecurity incidents?

Write your response in the incident report analysis template under the “respond” section.

### Step 7: Recover from the incident

Consider what steps need to be taken to help the organization recover from the cybersecurity incident. Reflect on all the information you gathered about the incident in the previous steps to consider which devices, systems, and processes need to be restored and recovered.

Consider the following questions:

- What information do you need to be able to recover immediately?
- What processes are in place to help the organization recover from the incident?

Write your response in the “recover” portion of the worksheet.
