# Understand risks, threats, and vulnerabilities

When security events occur, you’ll need to work in close coordination with others to address the problem. Doing so quickly requires clear communication between you and your team to get the job done.

Previously, you learned about three foundational security terms:

- **Risk**: Anything that can impact the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of an asset
- **Threat**: Any circumstance or event that can negatively impact assets
- **Vulnerability**: A weakness that can be exploited by a threat

These words tend to be used interchangeably in everyday life. But in security, they are used to describe very specific concepts when responding to and planning for security events. In this reading, you’ll identify what each term represents and how they are related.

## Security risk

Security plans are all about how an organization defines risk. However, this definition can vary widely by organization. As you may recall, a risk is anything that can impact the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of an asset. Since organizations have particular assets that they value, they tend to differ in how they interpret and approach risk.

One way to interpret risk is to consider the potential effects that negative events can have on a business. Another way to present this idea is with this calculation:

**Likelihood x Impact = Risk**

For example, you risk being late when you drive a car to work. This negative event is more likely to happen if you get a flat tire along the way. And the impact could be serious, like losing your job. All these factors influence how you approach commuting to work every day. The same is true for how businesses handle security risks.

In general, we calculate risk in this field to help:

- Prevent costly and disruptive events
- Identify improvements that can be made to systems and processes
- Determine which risks can be tolerated
- Prioritize the critical assets that require attention

The business impact of a negative event will always depend on the asset and the situation. Your primary focus as a security professional will be to focus on the likelihood side of the equation by dealing with certain factors that increase the odds of a problem.

## Risk factors

As you’ll discover throughout this course, there are two broad risk factors that you’ll be concerned with in the field:

- Threats
- Vulnerabilities

The risk of an asset being harmed or damaged depends greatly on whether a threat takes advantage of vulnerabilities.

Let’s apply this to the risk of being late to work. A threat would be a nail puncturing your tire, since tires are vulnerable to running over sharp objects. In terms of security planning, you would want to reduce the likelihood of this risk by driving on a clean road.

### Categories of threat

**Threats** are circumstances or events that can negatively impact assets. There are many different types of threats. However, they are commonly categorized as two types: intentional and unintentional.

For example, an intentional threat might be a malicious hacker who gains access to sensitive information by targeting a misconfigured application. An unintentional threat might be an employee who holds the door open for an unknown person and grants them access to a restricted area. Either one can cause an event that must be responded to.

### Categories of vulnerability

**Vulnerabilities** are weaknesses that can be exploited by threats. There’s a wide range of vulnerabilities, but they can be grouped into two categories: technical and human.

For example, a technical vulnerability can be misconfigured software that might give an unauthorized person access to important data. A human vulnerability can be a forgetful employee who loses their access card in a parking lot. Either one can lead to risk.

# Common classification requirements

**Asset management** is the process of tracking assets and the risks that affect them. The idea behind this process is simple: you can only protect what you know you have.

Previously, you learned that identifying, tracking, and classifying assets are all important parts of asset management. In this reading, you’ll learn more about the purpose and benefits of asset classification, including common classification levels.

## Why asset management matters

Keeping assets safe requires a workable system that helps businesses operate smoothly. Setting these systems up requires having detailed knowledge of the assets in an environment. For example, a bank needs to have money available each day to serve its customers. Equipment, devices, and processes need to be in place to ensure that money is available and secure from unauthorized access.

Organizations protect a variety of different assets. Some examples might include:

- Digital assets such as customer data or financial records.
- Information systems that process data, like networks or software.
- Physical assets which can include facilities, equipment, or supplies.
- Intangible assets such as brand reputation or intellectual property.

Regardless of its type, every asset should be classified and accounted for. As you may recall, **asset classification** is the practice of labeling assets based on sensitivity and importance to an organization. Determining each of those two factors varies, but the sensitivity and importance of an asset typically requires knowing the following:

- What you have
- Where it is
- Who owns it, and
- How important it is

An organization that classifies its assets does so based on these characteristics. Doing so helps them determine the sensitivity and value of an asset.

## Common asset classifications

Asset classification helps organizations implement an effective risk management strategy. It also helps them prioritize security resources, reduce IT costs, and stay in compliance with legal regulations.

The most common classification scheme is: restricted, confidential, internal-only, and public.

- **Restricted** is the highest level. This category is reserved for incredibly sensitive assets, like need-to-know information.
- **Confidential** refers to assets whose disclosure may lead to a significant negative impact on an organization.
- **Internal-only** describes assets that are available to employees and business partners.
- **Public** is the lowest level of classification. These assets have no negative consequences to the organization if they’re released.

How this scheme is applied depends greatly on the characteristics of an asset. It might surprise you to learn that identifying an asset’s owner is sometimes the most complicated characteristic to determine.

**Note**: Although many organizations adopt this classification scheme, there can be variability at the highest levels. For example, government organizations label their most sensitive assets as confidential instead of restricted.

## Challenges of classifying information

Identifying the owner of certain assets is straightforward, like the owner of a building. Other types of assets can be trickier to identify. This is especially true when it comes to information.

For example, a business might issue a laptop to one of its employees to allow them to work remotely. You might assume the business is the asset owner in this situation. But, what if the employee uses the laptop for personal matters, like storing their photos?

Ownership is just one characteristic that makes classifying information a challenge. Another concern is that information can have multiple classification values at the same time. For example, consider a letter addressed to you in the mail. The letter contains some public information that’s okay to share, like your name. It also contains fairly confidential pieces of information that you’d rather only be available to certain people, like your address. You’ll learn more about how these challenges are addressed as you continue through the program.

# Classify the assets connected to a home network

## Activity Overview

In this activity, you will classify assets connected to a home office network.

Asset management is a critical part of every organization's security plan. Remember that **asset management** is the process of tracking assets and the risks that affect them. Effective asset management starts with creating an **asset inventory**, or a catalog of assets that need to be protected. Then, it involves classifying assets based on their level of importance and sensitivity to risk.

Be sure to complete this activity before moving on. The next course item will provide you with a completed exemplar to compare to your own work.

## Scenario

Review the following scenario. Then, complete the step-by-step instructions.

One of the most valuable assets in the world today is information. Most information is accessed over a network. There tend to be a variety of devices connected to a network and each is a potential entry point to other assets.

An inventory of network devices can be a useful asset management tool. An inventory can highlight sensitive assets that require extra protection.

![network-devices](/google-cybersecurity-professional-certificate/05-assets-threats-and-vulnerabilities/assets/network-devices.png)

You’re operating a small business from your home and must create an inventory of your network devices. This will help you determine which ones contain sensitive information that require extra protection.

To do this, you will start by identifying three devices that have access to your home network. This might include devices such as:

- Desktop or laptop computers
- Smartphones
- Smart home devices
- Game consoles
- Storage devices or servers
- Video streaming devices

Then, you’ll list important characteristics of each device such as its owner, location, and type. Finally, you will assign each device a level of sensitivity based on how important it is to protect.

## Step-By-Step Instructions

Follow the instructions and answer the end-of-activity question to complete the activity. Then, go to the next course item to compare your work to a completed exemplar.

### Step 1: Access the template

To use the template for this course item, click the link below and select Use Template.

Link to template: [Home asset inventory](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1x2MoqRGpK1WFj3kg5gPjCVTczWzQ0odc1LrO-ZZbIys/template/preview?resourcekey=0-IWZFZN2pMTG6JbJcaCc7ig)

### Step 2: Identify assets

In the asset inventory spreadsheet, find the **Asset** column header. Consider the devices that may be connected to the home network. Examine devices in the scenario graphic to help you brainstorm.

Choose three devices that are not already listed in the spreadsheet and add them to the empty rows in the **Asset** column.

**Note**: A few devices, like a network router, desktop, and a guest smartphone have already been added for your reference.

### Step 3: Fill in the characteristics of each asset

List important characteristics, including **Network access, Owner**, and **Location** for each asset that you’ve identified.

Here’s an explanation of each characteristic:

- **Network access** describes how often the device is connected to the network.
- **Owner** describes the person responsible for the device.
- **Location** describes where the device is located in relation to the router.

### Step 4: Evaluate the access of network devices

Review the information that you’ve listed in the **Network access, Owner**, and **Location** columns.

In the **Notes** column, record 1 or 2 details or characteristics of each device. Do this by asking yourself questions about each:

- What kind of information is stored on the device?
- How does it connect to the network?
- Is the owner careful about securing it?

For example, the desktop computer contains sensitive information, like photos, that only the owner should have access to. In contrast, the network router uses one frequency for smart home devices and another for all other devices.

**Note**: Keep in mind that there might be some variation within each category. Try to identify details that could impact the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of information that’s connected to the network.

### Step 5: Classify the sensitivity of network devices

It’s time to classify assets based on the information you’ve collected. Do this by thinking about how an asset could impact your business if its security was compromised:

- What types of information would be disclosed or stolen?
- Could an attacker alter information on the device?
- What would happen to the business if this information were destroyed?

For example, the network router is classified as confidential because the owner has granted limited access to the device to specific users.

Find the **Sensitivity** column in the asset inventory. Type one of the four levels of sensitivity you previously learned about.

**Note**: You can use the Categories table as a guide for choosing an appropriate classification.

### Pro Tip: Save the template

Finally, be sure to save a blank copy of the template you used to complete this activity. You can use it for further practice or in your professional projects. These templates will help you work through your thought processes and demonstrate your experience to potential employers.

### What to Include in Your Response

Be sure to include the following elements in your completed activity:

- List of 3 devices on the home network
- List network access, owner, and location for each device
- 1–2 notes on network access
- A sensitivity classification

## Activity Exemplar

Link to exemplar: [Home asset inventory exemplar](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kdMs5ejteq9ZyH9j4pdvSO2kSOVGeS5hKa4OWGrvlCU/template/preview#gid=0)

Compare the exemplar to your completed asset inventory. Review your work using each of the criteria in the exemplar. What did you do well? Where can you improve? Use your answers to these questions to guide you as you continue to progress through the course.

**Note**: The exemplar represents one possible way to complete the activity. Yours will likely differ in certain ways. What’s important is that your asset inventory lists the common characteristics of network connected devices and evaluates them based on their level of sensitivity.

The exemplar uses detail from the given scenario and adheres to the following guidelines:

- Identify 3 devices on the home network
- List network access, owner, and location details for each device
- Include 1–2 notes on network access
- Classify each asset based on level of sensitivity

The exemplar only lists devices with network access because that fits within the scope of this scenario. However, asset inventories might include non-network devices. For example, a homeowner might also keep track of physical assets like a safe or digital assets like family videos.

Classifying assets based on their level of importance can be subjective. Much of asset classification depends on identifying an asset's owner, their location, and other important characteristics. This information should be evaluated before determining who should have access to an asset and what they are authorized to do. Remember, classification helps determine the level of impact an asset can have on a business if it were disclosed, altered, or destroyed.

# The emergence of cloud security

One of the most significant technology developments this century has been the emergence of cloud computing. The United Kingdom's National Cyber Security Centre defines cloud computing as, “An on-demand, massively scalable service, hosted on shared infrastructure, accessible via the internet.”

Earlier, you learned that most information is in the form of data, which is in a constant state of change. In recent years, businesses started moving their data to the cloud. The adoption of cloud-based services has complicated how information is kept safe online. In this reading, you’ll learn about these challenges and the opportunities they’ve created for security professionals.

## Soaring into the cloud

Starting an online business used to be a complicated and costly process. In years past, companies had to build and maintain their own internal solutions to operate in the digital marketplace. Now, it’s much easier for anyone to participate because of the cloud.

The availability of cloud technologies has drastically changed how businesses operate online. These new tools allow companies to scale and adapt quickly while also lowering their costs. Despite these benefits, the shift to cloud-based services has also introduced a range of new cybersecurity challenges that put assets at risk.

## Cloud-based services

The term cloud-based services refers to a variety of on demand or web-based business solutions. Depending on a company’s needs and budget, services can range from website hosting, to application development environments, to entire back-end infrastructure.

There are three main categories of cloud-based services:

- Software as a service (SaaS)
- Platform as a service (PaaS)
- Infrastructure as a service (IaaS)

### Software as a service (SaaS)

SaaS refers to front-end applications that users access via a web browser. The service providers host, manage, and maintain all of the back-end systems for those applications. Common examples of SaaS services include applications like Gmail™ email service, Slack, and Zoom software.

### Platform as a service (PaaS)

PaaS refers to back-end application development tools that clients can access online. Developers use these resources to write code and build, manage, and deploy their own apps. Meanwhile, the cloud service providers host and maintain the back-end hardware and software that the apps use to operate. Some examples of PaaS services include Google App Engine™ platform, Heroku®, and VMware Cloud Foundry.

### Infrastructure as a service (IaaS)

IaaS customers are given remote access to a range of back-end systems that are hosted by the cloud service provider. This includes data processing servers, storage, networking resources, and more. Resources are commonly licensed as needed, making it a cost-effective alternative to buying and maintaining on premises.

Cloud-based services allow companies to connect with their customers, employees, and business partners over the internet. Some of the largest organizations in the world offer cloud-based services:

- Google Cloud Platform
- Microsoft Azure

## Cloud security

Shifting applications and infrastructure over to the cloud can make it easier to operate an online business. It can also complicate keeping data private and safe. Cloud security is a growing subfield of cybersecurity that specifically focuses on the protection of data, applications, and infrastructure in the cloud.

In a traditional model, organizations had their entire IT infrastructure on premises. Protecting those systems was entirely up to the internal security team in that environment. These responsibilities are not so clearly defined when part or all of an operational environment is in the cloud.

For example, a PaaS client pays to access the resources they need to build their applications. So, it is reasonable to expect them to be responsible for securing the apps they build. On the other hand, the responsibility for maintaining the security of the servers they are accessing should belong to the cloud service provider because there are other clients using the same systems.

In cloud security, this concept is known as the shared responsibility model. Clients are commonly responsible for securing anything that is directly within their control:

- Identity and access management
- Resource configuration
- Data handling

**Note**: The amount of responsibility that is delegated to a service provider varies depending on the service being used: SaaS, PaaS, and IaaS.

## Cloud security challenges

All service providers do their best to deliver secure products to their customers. Much of their success depends on preventing breaches and how well they can protect sensitive information. However, since data is stored in the cloud and accessed over the internet, several challenges arise:

- **Misconfiguration** is one of the biggest concerns. Customers of cloud-based services are responsible for configuring their own security environment. Oftentimes, they use out-of-the-box configurations that fail to address their specific security objectives.
- **Cloud-native breaches** are more likely to occur due to misconfigured services.
- **Monitoring access might be difficult** depending on the client and level of service.
- **Meeting regulatory standards** is also a concern, particularly in industries that are required by law to follow specific requirements such as HIPAA, PCI DSS, and GDPR.

Many other challenges exist besides these. As more businesses adopt cloud-based services, there’s a growing need for cloud security professionals to meet a growing number of risks. Burning Glass, a leading labor market analytics firm, ranks cloud security among the most in-demand skills in cybersecurity.

## Resources for more information

Cloud security is one of the fastest growing subfields of cybersecurity. There are a variety of resources available online to learn more about this specialized topic.

- [The U.K.’s National Cyber Security Centre](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/cloud/understanding-cloud-services/cloud-security-shared-responsibility-model) has a detailed guide for choosing, using, and deploying cloud services securely based on the shared responsibility model.
- [The Cloud Security Alliance®](https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/) is an organization dedicated to creating secure cloud environments. They offer access to cloud security-specific research, certification, and products to users with a paid membership.
- [CompTIA Cloud+](https://www.comptia.org/blog/your-next-move-cloud-security-specialist) is a certificate program designed to teach you the foundational skills needed to become a cloud security specialist.

# Security guidelines in action

## Origins of the framework

Originally released in 2014, NIST developed the Cybersecurity Framework to protect critical infrastructure in the United States. NIST was selected to develop the CSF because they are an unbiased source of scientific data and practices. NIST eventually adapted the CSF to fit the needs of businesses in the public and private sector. Their goal was to make the framework more flexible, making it easier to adopt for small businesses or anyone else that might lack the resources to develop their own security plans.

## Components of the CSF

As you might recall, the framework consists of three main components: the core, tiers, and profiles. In the following sections, you'll learn more about each of these CSF components.

### Core

The CSF core is a set of desired cybersecurity outcomes that help organizations customize their security plan. It consists of five functions, or parts: Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover. These functions are commonly used as an informative reference to help organizations identify their most important assets and protect those assets with appropriate safeguards. The CSF core is also used to understand ways to detect attacks and develop response and recovery plans should an attack happen.

### Tiers

The CSF tiers are a way of measuring the sophistication of an organization's cybersecurity program. CSF tiers are measured on a scale of 1 to 4. Tier 1 is the lowest score, indicating that a limited set of security controls have been implemented. Overall, CSF tiers are used to assess an organization's security posture and identify areas for improvement.

### Profiles

The CSF profiles are pre-made templates of the NIST CSF that are developed by a team of industry experts. CSF profiles are tailored to address the specific risks of an organization or industry. They are used to help organizations develop a baseline for their cybersecurity plans, or as a way of comparing their current cybersecurity posture to a specific industry standard.

**Note**: The core, tiers, and profiles were each designed to help any business improve their security operations. Although there are only three components, the entire framework consists of a complex system of subcategories and processes.

## Implementing the CSF

As you might recall, compliance is an important concept in security. **Compliance** is the process of adhering to internal standards and external regulations. In other words, compliance is a way of measuring how well an organization is protecting their assets. The **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)** is a voluntary framework that consists of standards, guidelines, and best practices to manage cybersecurity risk. Organizations may choose to use the CSF to achieve compliance with a variety of regulations.

**Note**: Regulations are rules that must be followed, while frameworks are resources you can choose to use.

Since its creation, many businesses have used the NIST CSF. However, CSF can be a challenge to implement due to its high level of detail. It can also be tough to find where the framework fits in. For example, some businesses have established security plans, making it unclear how CSF can benefit them. Alternatively, some businesses might be in the early stages of building their plans and need a place to start.

In any scenario, the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) provides detailed guidance that any organization can use to implement the CSF. This is a quick overview and summary of their recommendations:

- **Create a current profile** of the security operations and outline the specific needs of your business.
- **Perform a risk assessment** to identify which of your current operations are meeting business and regulatory standards.
- **Analyze and prioritize existing gaps** in security operations that place the businesses assets at risk.
- **Implement a plan of action** to achieve your organization’s goals and objectives.

**Pro tip**: Always consider current risk, threat, and vulnerability trends when using the NIST CSF.

You can learn more about implementing the CSF in [this report by CISA that outlines how the framework was applied in the commercial facilities sector](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/Commercial_Facilities_Sector_Cybersecurity_Framework_Implementation_Guidance_FINAL_508.pdf).

## Industries embracing the CSF

The NIST CSF has continued to evolve since its introduction in 2014. Its design is influenced by the standards and best practices of some of the largest companies in the world.

A benefit of the framework is that it aligns with the security practices of many organizations across the global economy. It also helps with regulatory compliance that might be shared by business partners.

# Score risks based on their likelihood and severity

## Activity Overview

In this activity, you will practice performing a risk assessment by evaluating vulnerabilities that commonly threaten business operations. Then, you will decide how to prioritize your resources based on the risk scores you assign each vulnerability.

You might recall that the purpose of having a security plan is to be prepared for risks. Assessing potential risks is one of the first steps of the **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)**, a voluntary framework that consists of standards, guidelines, and best practices to manage cybersecurity risk. Risk assessments are how security teams determine whether their security operations are adequately positioned to prevent cyber attacks and protect sensitive information.

Be sure to complete this activity before moving on. The next course item will provide you with a completed exemplar to compare to your own work.

## Scenario

Review the following scenario. Then complete the step-by-step instructions.

You've joined a new cybersecurity team at a commercial bank. The team is conducting a risk assessment of the bank's current operational environment. As part of the assessment, they are creating a risk register to help them focus on securing the most vulnerable risks.

A **risk register** is a central record of potential risks to an organization's assets, information systems, and data. Security teams commonly use risk registers when conducting a risk assessment.

Your supervisor asks you to evaluate a set of risks that the cybersecurity team has recorded in the risk register. For each risk, you will first determine how likely that risk is to occur. Then, you will determine how severely that risk may impact the bank. Finally, you will calculate a score for the severity of that risk. You will then compare scores across all risks so your team can determine how to prioritize their attention for each risk.

## Step-By-Step Instructions

Follow the instructions and answer the question below to complete the activity. Then, go to the next course item to compare your work to a completed exemplar.

### Step 1: Access the template

To use the template for this course item, click the following link and select Use Template.

Link to template: [Risk register](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fqPEK1Cy9cLsR4SvewhqfanU75JkAegy1TAJNcWex5U/template/preview?resourcekey=0-rYoRJ_z6hCgITUqRwmOoCQ)

### Step 2: Understand the operating environment

When conducting a risk assessment, it's important to consider the factors that could cause a security event. This often starts with understanding the operating environment.

In this scenario, your team has identified characteristics of the operating environment that could factor into the bank's risk profile:

_The bank is located in a coastal area with low crime rates. Many people and systems handle the bank's data—100 on-premise employees and 20 remote employees. The customer base of the bank includes 2,000 individual accounts and 200 commercial accounts. The bank's services are marketed by a professional sports team and ten local businesses in the community. There are strict financial regulations that require the bank to secure their data and funds, like having enough cash available each day to meet Federal Reserve requirements._

### Step 3: Consider potential risks to assets

Security events are possible when assets are at risk. The source of a risk can range from malicious attackers to accidental human errors. A risk source can even come from natural or environmental hazards, such as a structural failure or power outage.

The bank's funds are one of its key assets. Your team has listed five primary risks to the bank's funds:

- Business email compromise
- Compromised user database
- Financial records leak
- Theft
- Supply chain attack

Consider these potential risks in relation to the bank's operating environment. Then, write **2-3 sentences (40-60 words)** in the **Notes** area of the template describing how security events are possible considering the risks facing the funds in this operating environment.

### Step 4: Score risks based on likelihood

As you might recall, risk can be calculated with this simple formula:

**Likelihood x Impact = Risk**

In order to calculate the score for a security risk, you must first estimate and score the likelihood of the risk causing a security event. The likelihood of a risk can be based on available evidence, prior experience, or expert judgment. A common way to estimate the likelihood of the risk is to determine the potential frequency of the risk occurring:

- Could the risk happen once a day?
- Could the risk happen once a month?
- Could the risk happen once in a year?

For example, the bank must have enough funds available each day to meet its legal requirements. A potential risk that could prevent the bank from replenishing its funds is a supply chain disruption. Being located in a coastal area, there's a likelihood that the bank may experience supply chain disruptions caused by hurricanes. However, a hurricane might only impact the bank every few years, so you can score the likelihood as low.

In this instance, the team is scoring the likelihood of an event on a scale of 1-3:

- **1** represents an event with a low chance of occuring.
- **2** represents an event with a moderate chance of occuring.
- **3** represents a high chance of occuring.

Review the **Risk(s), Description**, and **Notes** of the risk register template. Refer to the risk matrix and use it to estimate a likelihood score for each risk. Then, enter a **score (1-3)** for each risk in the **Likelihood** column of the register.

### Step 5: Score risks based on severity

A severity score is an estimate of the overall impact that might occur as a result of an event. For example, damage can occur to a company's reputation or finances and there may be a loss of data, customers, or assets. Evaluating the severity of a risk helps businesses determine the level of risk they can tolerate and how assets might be affected.

When evaluating the severity of a risk, consider the potential consequences of that risk occurring:

- How would the business be affected?
- What's the financial harm to the business and its customers?
- Can important operations or services be impacted?
- Are there regulations that can be violated?
- What is the reputational damage to the company's standing?

Use the top row of the risk matrix and consider the potential impact of each risk. Estimate a severity score for each risk. Then, enter a **score (1-3)** for each risk in the **Severity** column of the register:

- **1** (low severity)
- **2** (moderate severity)
- **3** (high severity)

For example, a leak of financial records might lead to a loss of profits, a loss of customers, and heavy regulatory fines. A risk such as this might receive a severity score of 3 because it greatly impacts the bank's ability to operate.

### Step 6: Calculate an overall risk score

Ultimately, the goal of performing a risk assessment is to help security teams prioritize their efforts and resources.

Using the risk formula, multiply the likelihood and severity score for each risk. Then, enter a priority **score (1-9)** for each of the risks in the **Priority** column of the register.

### What to Include in Your Response

Be sure to address the following criteria in your completed activity:

- 2-3 sentences describing the risk factors
- 5 likelihood scores
- 5 severity scores
- 5 overall risk scores

## Completed Exemplar

Link to exemplar: [Risk register](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1go-P591TEFasex_iNcz8D8FmYNelwaGDyahGZD2swh4/template/preview)

Compare the exemplar to your completed activity. Review your work using each of the criteria in the exemplar. What did you do well? Where can you improve? Use your answers to these questions to guide you as you continue to progress through the course.

**Note**: The exemplar represents one possible way to complete the activity. Yours will likely differ in certain ways. What’s important is that you've considered how likelihood and impact affect how organizations approach risk management.

### Notes

Some risk factors to have considered might have been the number of other companies that interact with the bank. These sources of risk might introduce incidents beyond the bank's control. Also, the risk of theft is important to consider because of the number of customers and the operational impact it could have to the business.

### Likelihood

A range of likelihood scores were estimated based on factors that could lead to a security incident. Each risk was scored as a 1, 2, or 3 on a risk matrix, meaning the chances of occurring were rare, likely, or certain. A supply chain attack caused by natural disaster was scored with a 1, meaning it was regarded as unlikely due to the unpredictability of those events. On the other hand, compromised data events were scored a 2 because they are likely to occur given the possible causes.

### Severity

No risk received a severity score less than 2 because risks that involve data breaches such as business email compromise, can have serious consequences. Customers at a bank trust the businesses to protect their money and personal information. Also, the bank's operations could be terminated if they fail to comply with regulations.

### Priority

A financial records leak received the highest overall risk score of 9. This indicates that this risk is almost certain to happen and would greatly impact the bank's ability to operate. Such a high overall score signals the security team to prioritize remediating, or resolving any issues related to that risk before moving on to risks that scored lower.
