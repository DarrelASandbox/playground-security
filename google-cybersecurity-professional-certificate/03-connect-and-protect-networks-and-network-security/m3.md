# Denial of Service(DoS) attacks

**Denial of Service(DoS) attacks**: An attack that targets a network or server and floods it with network traffic.

**Distributed Denial of Service(DDoS) attacks**: A type of denial of service attack that uses multiple devices or servers in different locations to flood the target network with unwanted traffic.

**Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP)**: An internet protocol used by devices to tell each other about data transmission errors across the network.

**Ping of death**: A type of DoS attack caused when a hacker pings a system by sending it an oversized ICMP packet that is bigger than 64kb.

## SYN (synchronize) flood attack

A SYN Flood Attack is a type of **Denial of Service (DoS)** attack that targets the TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) handshake to overwhelm a server and disrupt its ability to handle legitimate traffic.

- Exploits the TCP handshake process to consume server resources.
- Aimed at making the server unavailable to legitimate users by filling its connection queue with half-open connections.

### Key Characteristics

- Targets the **SYN-ACK** stage of the TCP handshake.
- Uses spoofed or incomplete requests to prevent connection completion.
- Causes resource exhaustion on the server (CPU, memory, and connection tables).

### How the TCP Handshake Works

#### Normal Handshake Process

1. **SYN**: Client sends a synchronization packet to the server.
2. **SYN-ACK**: Server acknowledges with a SYN-ACK packet.
3. **ACK**: Client responds with an acknowledgment, completing the handshake.

#### TCP Handshake in a SYN Flood Attack

1. Attacker sends a large volume of **SYN** packets to the target.
2. Server responds with **SYN-ACK** packets, reserving resources for each connection.
3. The final **ACK** from the attacker never arrives, leaving the connections half-open.

### Impact of a SYN Flood Attack

- **Resource Exhaustion**:
  - Server’s memory and CPU are consumed.
  - Connection queue is filled, blocking legitimate traffic.
- **Service Downtime**:
  - Disrupts operations by making the server unavailable.
- **Business and Financial Loss**:
  - Critical services are impacted, leading to revenue loss and reputational damage.

### Detection and Mitigation Strategies

#### Detection Methods

- Monitor network traffic for abnormal patterns of SYN packets.
- Use Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) to identify flood attempts.

#### Mitigation Techniques

- **Rate Limiting**:
  - Restricts the number of half-open connections allowed.
- **SYN Cookies**:
  - Encodes connection information in the SYN-ACK response without allocating resources until the handshake is completed.
- **Firewall Rules**:
  - Block traffic from suspicious or spoofed IP addresses.
- **Load Balancers**:
  - Distribute traffic across multiple servers to reduce individual server load.

| **Mitigation Technique** | **Description**                           | **Effectiveness** |
| :----------------------: | ----------------------------------------- | :---------------: |
|      Rate Limiting       | Limits the rate of incoming SYN requests. |       High        |
|       SYN Cookies        | Delays resource allocation until ACK.     |     Very High     |
|      Firewall Rules      | Filters malicious traffic.                |     Moderate      |
|      Load Balancers      | Spreads traffic across servers.           |       High        |

# How intrusions compromise your system

## Network interception attacks

Network interception attacks work by intercepting network traffic and stealing valuable information or interfering with the transmission in some way.

Malicious actors can use hardware or software tools to capture and inspect data in transit. This is referred to as **packet sniffing**. In addition to seeing information that they are not entitled to, malicious actors can also intercept network traffic and alter it. These attacks can cause damage to an organization’s network by inserting malicious code modifications or altering the message and interrupting network operations. For example, an attacker can intercept a bank transfer and change the account receiving the funds to one that the attacker controls.

Later in this course you will learn more about malicious packet sniffing, and other types of network interception attacks: on-path attacks and replay attacks.

## Backdoor attacks

A **backdoor attack** is another type of attack you will need to be aware of as a security analyst. An organization may have a lot of security measures in place, including cameras, biometric scans and access codes to keep employees from entering and exiting without being seen. However, an employee might work around the security measures by finding a backdoor to the building that is not as heavily monitored, allowing them to sneak out for the afternoon without being seen.

In cybersecurity, backdoors are weaknesses intentionally left by programmers or system and network administrators that bypass normal access control mechanisms. Backdoors are intended to help programmers conduct troubleshooting or administrative tasks. However, backdoors can also be installed by attackers after they’ve compromised an organization to ensure they have persistent access.

Once the hacker has entered an insecure network through a backdoor, they can cause extensive damage: installing malware, performing a denial of service (DoS) attack, stealing private information or changing other security settings that leaves the system vulnerable to other attacks. A **DoS attack** is an attack that targets a network or server and floods it with network traffic.

## Possible impacts on an organization

As you’ve learned already, network attacks can have a significant negative impact on an organization. Let’s examine some potential consequences.

- **Financial**: When a system is taken offline with a DoS attack or some other tactic, they prevent a company from performing tasks that generate revenue. Depending on the size of an organization, interrupted operations can cost millions of dollars. Reparation costs to rebuild software infrastructure and to pay large sums associated with potential ransomware can be financially difficult. In addition, if a malicious actor gets access to the personal information of the company’s clients or customers, the company may face heavy litigation and settlement costs if customers seek legal recourse.
- **Reputation**: Attacks can also have a negative impact on the reputation of an organization. If it becomes public knowledge that a company has experienced a cyber attack, the public may become concerned about the security practices of the organization. They may stop trusting the company with their personal information and choose a competitor to fulfill their needs.
- **Public safety**: If an attack occurs on a government network, this can potentially impact the safety and welfare of the citizens of a country. In recent years, defense agencies across the globe are investing heavily in combating cyber warfare tactics. If a malicious actor gained access to a power grid, a public water system, or even a military defense communication system, the public could face physical harm due to a network intrusion attack.

# Read tcpdump logs

A **network protocol analyzer**, sometimes called a packet sniffer or a packet analyzer, is a tool designed to capture and analyze data traffic within a network. They are commonly used as investigative tools to monitor networks and identify suspicious activity. There are a wide variety of network protocol analyzers available, but some of the most common analyzers include:

- SolarWinds NetFlow Traffic Analyzer
- ManageEngine OpManager
- Azure Network Watcher
- Wireshark
- tcpdump

This reading will focus exclusively on tcpdump, though you can apply what you learn here to many of the other network protocol analyzers you'll use as a cybersecurity analyst to defend against any network intrusions. In an upcoming activity, you’ll review a tcpdump data traffic log and identify a DoS attack to practice these skills.

## tcpdump

**tcpdump** is a command-line network protocol analyzer. It is popular, lightweight–meaning it uses little memory and has a low CPU usage–and uses the open-source libpcap library. tcpdump is text based, meaning all commands in tcpdump are executed in the terminal. It can also be installed on other Unix-based operating systems, such as macOS®. It is preinstalled on many Linux distributions.

tcpdump provides a brief packet analysis and converts key information about network traffic into formats easily read by humans. It prints information about each packet directly into your terminal. tcpdump also displays the source IP address, destination IP addresses, and the port numbers being used in the communications.

## Interpreting output

tcpdump prints the output of the command as the sniffed packets in the command line, and optionally to a log file, after a command is executed. The output of a packet capture contains many pieces of important information about the network traffic.

![tcpdump](/google-cybersecurity-professional-certificate/03-connect-and-protect-networks-and-network-security/assets/tcpdump.png)

Some information you receive from a packet capture includes:

- **Timestamp**: The output begins with the timestamp, formatted as hours, minutes, seconds, and fractions of a second.
- **Source IP**: The packet’s origin is provided by its source IP address.
- **Source port**: This port number is where the packet originated.
- **Destination IP**: The destination IP address is where the packet is being transmitted to.
- **Destination port**: This port number is where the packet is being transmitted to.

**Note**: By default, tcpdump will attempt to resolve host addresses to hostnames. It'll also replace port numbers with commonly associated services that use these ports.

## Common uses

tcpdump and other network protocol analyzers are commonly used to capture and view network communications and to collect statistics about the network, such as troubleshooting network performance issues. They can also be used to:

- Establish a baseline for network traffic patterns and network utilization metrics.
- Detect and identify malicious traffic
- Create customized alerts to send the right notifications when network issues or security threats arise.
- Locate unauthorized instant messaging (IM), traffic, or wireless access points.

However, attackers can also use network protocol analyzers maliciously to gain information about a specific network. For example, attackers can capture data packets that contain sensitive information, such as account usernames and passwords. As a cybersecurity analyst, It’s important to understand the purpose and uses of network protocol analyzers.

# Real-life DDoS attack

## A DDoS targeting a widely used DNS server

In previous videos, you learned about the function of a DNS server. As a review, DNS servers translate website domain names into the IP address of the system that contains the information for the website. For instance, if a user were to type in a website URL, a DNS server would translate that into a numeric IP address that directs network traffic to the location of the website’s server.

On the day of the DDoS attack we are studying, many large companies were using a DNS service provider. The service provider was hosting the DNS system for these companies. This meant that when internet users typed in the URL of the website they wanted to access, their devices would be directed to the right place. On October 21, 2016, the service provider was the victim of a DDoS attack.

## Leading up to the attack

Before the attack on the service provider, a group of university students created a botnet with the intention to attack various gaming servers and networks. A **botnet** is a collection of computers infected by malware that are under the control of a single threat actor, known as the “bot-herder." Each computer in the botnet can be remotely controlled to send a data packet to a target system. In a botnet attack, cyber criminals instruct all the bots on the botnet to send data packets to the target system at the same time, resulting in a DDoS attack.

The group of university students posted the code for the botnet online so that it would be accessible to thousands of internet users and authorities wouldn’t be able to trace the botnet back to the students. In doing so, they made it possible for other malicious actors to learn the code to the botnet and control it remotely. This included the cyber criminals who attacked the DNS service provider.

## The day of attack

At 7:00 a.m. on the day of the attack, the botnet sent tens of millions of DNS requests to the service provider. This overwhelmed the system and the DNS service shut down. This meant that all of the websites that used the service provider could not be reached. When users tried to access various websites that used the service provider, they were not directed to the website they typed in their browser. Outages for each web service occurred all over North America and Europe.

The service provider’s systems were restored after only two hours of downtime. Although the cyber criminals sent subsequent waves of botnet attacks, the DNS company was prepared and able to mitigate the impact.

# Analyze network layer communication

## Activity Overview

In this activity, you will analyze DNS and ICMP traffic in transit using data from a network protocol analyzer tool. You will identify which network protocol was utilized in assessment of the cybersecurity incident.

In the internet layer of the TCP/IP model, the IP formats data packets into IP datagrams. The information provided in the datagram of an IP packet can provide security analysts with insight into suspicious data packets in transit.

Knowing how to identify potentially malicious traffic on a network can help cybersecurity analysts assess security risks on a network and reinforce network security.

Be sure to complete this activity before moving on. The next course item will provide you with a completed exemplar to compare to your own work.

## Scenario

Review the scenario below. Then complete the step-by-step instructions.

You are a cybersecurity analyst working at a company that specializes in providing IT services for clients. Several customers of clients reported that they were not able to access the client company website www.yummyrecipesforme.com, and saw the error “destination port unreachable” after waiting for the page to load.

You are tasked with analyzing the situation and determining which network protocol was affected during this incident. To start, you attempt to visit the website and you also receive the error “destination port unreachable.” To troubleshoot the issue, you load your network analyzer tool, tcpdump, and attempt to load the webpage again. To load the webpage, your browser sends a query to a DNS server via the UDP protocol to retrieve the IP address for the website's domain name; this is part of the DNS protocol. Your browser then uses this IP address as the destination IP for sending an HTTPS request to the web server to display the webpage The analyzer shows that when you send UDP packets to the DNS server, you receive ICMP packets containing the error message: “udp port 53 unreachable.”

![m3-scenario](/google-cybersecurity-professional-certificate/03-connect-and-protect-networks-and-network-security/assets/m3-scenario.png)

In the tcpdump log, you find the following information:

1. The first two lines of the log file show the initial outgoing request from your computer to the DNS server requesting the IP address of yummyrecipesforme.com. This request is sent in a UDP packet.
2. The third and fourth lines of the log show the response to your UDP packet. In this case, the ICMP 203.0.113.2 line is the start of the error message indicating that the UDP packet was undeliverable to port 53 of the DNS server.
3. In front of each request and response, you find timestamps that indicate when the incident happened. In the log, this is the first sequence of numbers displayed: 13:24:32.192571. This means the time is 1:24 p.m., 32.192571 seconds.
4. After the timestamps, you will find the source and destination IP addresses. In the first line, where the UDP packet travels from your browser to the DNS server, this information is displayed as: 192.51.100.15 > 203.0.113.2.domain. The IP address to the left of the greater than (>) symbol is the source address, which in this example is your computer’s IP address. The IP address to the right of the greater than (>) symbol is the destination IP address. In this case, it is the IP address for the DNS server: 203.0.113.2.domain. For the ICMP error response, the source address is 203.0.113.2 and the destination is your computers IP address 192.51.100.15.
5. After the source and destination IP addresses, there can be a number of additional details like the protocol, port number of the source, and flags. In the first line of the error log, the query identification number appears as: 35084. The plus sign after the query identification number indicates there are flags associated with the UDP message. The "A?" indicates a flag associated with the DNS request for an A record, where an A record maps a domain name to an IP address. The third line displays the protocol of the response message to the browser: "ICMP," which is followed by an ICMP error message.
6. The error message, "udp port 53 unreachable" is mentioned in the last line. Port 53 is a port for DNS service. The word "unreachable" in the message indicates the UDP message requesting an IP address for the domain "www.yummyrecipesforme.com" did not go through to the DNS server because no service was listening on the receiving DNS port.
7. The remaining lines in the log indicate that ICMP packets were sent two more times, but the same delivery error was received both times.

Now that you have captured data packets using a network analyzer tool, it is your job to identify which network protocol and service were impacted by this incident. Then, you will need to write a follow-up report.

As an analyst, you can inspect network traffic and network data to determine what is causing network-related issues during cybersecurity incidents. Later in this course, you will demonstrate how to manage and resolve incidents. For now, you only need to analyze the situation.

This event, in the meantime, is being handled by security engineers after you and other analysts have reported the issue to your direct supervisor.

# Overview of interception tactics

## Passive packet sniffing

A type of attack where data packets are read in transit.

## Active packet sniffing

A type of attack where data packets are manipulated in transit.

## A closer review of packet sniffing

As you learned in a previous video, **packet sniffing** is the practice of capturing and inspecting data packets across a network. On a private network, data packets are directed to the matching destination device on the network.

The device’s Network Interface Card (NIC) is a piece of hardware that connects the device to a network. The NIC reads the data transmission, and if it contains the device’s MAC address, it accepts the packet and sends it to the device to process the information based on the protocol. This occurs in all standard network operations. However, a NIC can be set to promiscuous mode, which means that it accepts all traffic on the network, even the packets that aren’t addressed to the NIC’s device. You’ll learn more about NIC’s later in the program. Malicious actors might use software like Wireshark to capture the data on a private network and store it for later use. They can then use the personal information to their own advantage. Alternatively, they might use the IP and MAC addresses of authorized users of the private network to perform IP spoofing.

## A closer review of IP spoofing

After a malicious actor has sniffed packets on the network, they can impersonate the IP and MAC addresses of authorized devices to perform an IP spoofing attack. Firewalls can prevent IP spoofing attacks by configuring it to refuse unauthorized IP packets and suspicious traffic. Next, you’ll examine a few common IP spoofing attacks that are important to be familiar with as a security analyst.

### On-path attack

An **on-path attack** happens when a hacker intercepts the communication between two devices or servers that have a trusted relationship. The transmission between these two trusted network devices could contain valuable information like usernames and passwords that the malicious actor can collect. An on-path attack is sometimes referred to as a **meddler-in-the middle attack** because the hacker is hiding in the middle of communications between two trusted parties.

Or, it could be that the intercepted transmission contains a DNS system look-up. You’ll recall from an earlier video that a DNS server translates website domain names into IP addresses. If a malicious actor intercepts a transmission containing a DNS lookup, they could spoof the DNS response from the server and redirect a domain name to a different IP address, perhaps one that contains malicious code or other threats. The most important way to protect against an on-path attack is to encrypt your data in transit, e.g. using TLS.

### Smurf attack

A **smurf attack** is a network attack that is performed when an attacker sniffs an authorized user’s IP address and floods it with packets. Once the spoofed packet reaches the broadcast address, it is sent to all of the devices and servers on the network.

In a smurf attack, IP spoofing is combined with another denial of service (DoS) technique to flood the network with unwanted traffic. For example, the spoofed packet could include an Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) ping. As you learned earlier, ICMP is used to troubleshoot a network. But if too many ICMP messages are transmitted, the ICMP echo responses overwhelm the servers on the network and they shut down. This creates a denial of service and can bring an organization’s operations to a halt.

An important way to protect against a smurf attack is to use an advanced firewall that can monitor any unusual traffic on the network. Most next generation firewalls (NGFW) include features that detect network anomalies to ensure that oversized broadcasts are detected before they have a chance to bring down the network.

### DoS attack

As you’ve learned, once the malicious actor has sniffed the network traffic, they can impersonate an authorized user. A **Denial of Service attack** is a class of attacks where the attacker prevents the compromised system from performing legitimate activity or responding to legitimate traffic. Unlike IP spoofing, however, the attacker will not receive a response from the targeted host. Everything about the data packet is authorized including the IP address in the header of the packet. In IP spoofing attacks, the malicious actor uses IP packets containing fake IP addresses. The attackers keep sending IP packets containing fake IP addresses until the network server crashes.

**Pro Tip**: Remember the principle of defense-in-depth. There isn’t one perfect strategy for stopping each kind of attack. You can layer your defense by using multiple strategies. In this case, using industry standard encryption will strengthen your security and help you defend from DoS attacks on more than one level.

# Analyze network attacks

## Activity Overview

In this activity, you will consider a scenario involving a customer of the company that you work for who experiences a security issue when accessing the company’s website. You will identify the likely cause of the service interruption. Then, you will explain how the attack occurred and the negative impact it had on the website.

In this course, you have learned about several common network attacks. You have learned their names, how they are carried out, and the characteristics of each attack from the perspective of the target. Understanding how attacks impact a network will help you troubleshoot issues on your organization’s network. It will also help you take steps to mitigate damage and protect a network from future attacks. To review attacks, visit [Identify: Network Attacks](https://www.coursera.org/learn/networks-and-network-security/ungradedWidget/8hRdi/identify-network-attacks)

Be sure to complete this activity before moving on. The next course item will provide you with a completed exemplar to compare to your own work.

## Scenario

Review the following scenario. Then complete the step-by-step instructions.

You work as a security analyst for a travel agency that advertises sales and promotions on the company’s website. The employees of the company regularly access the company’s sales webpage to search for vacation packages their customers might like.

One afternoon, you receive an automated alert from your monitoring system indicating a problem with the web server. You attempt to visit the company’s website, but you receive a connection timeout error message in your browser.

You use a packet sniffer to capture data packets in transit to and from the web server. You notice a large number of TCP SYN requests coming from an unfamiliar IP address. The web server appears to be overwhelmed by the volume of incoming traffic and is losing its ability to respond to the abnormally large number of SYN requests. You suspect the server is under attack by a malicious actor.

You take the server offline temporarily so that the machine can recover and return to a normal operating status. You also configure the company’s firewall to block the IP address that was sending the abnormal number of SYN requests. You know that your IP blocking solution won’t last long, as an attacker can spoof other IP addresses to get around this block. You need to alert your manager about this problem quickly and discuss the next steps to stop this attacker and prevent this problem from happening again. You will need to be prepared to tell your boss about the type of attack you discovered and how it was affecting the web server and employees.

### Step 3: Identify the type of attack causing this network interruption

Reflect on the types of network intrusion attacks that you have learned about in this course so far. As a security analyst, identifying the type of network attack based on the incident is the first step to managing the attack and preventing similar attacks in the future.

Here are some questions to consider when determining what type of attack occurred:

- What do you currently understand about network attacks?
- Which type of attack would likely result in the symptoms described in the scenario?
- What is the difference between a denial of service (DoS) and distributed denial of service (DDoS)?
- Why is the website taking a long time to load and reporting a connection timeout error?

Review the Wireshark reading from step 2 and try to identify patterns in the logged network traffic. Analyze the patterns to determine which type of network attack occurred. Write your analysis in section one of the Cybersecurity incident report template provided.

### Step 4: Explain how the attack is causing the website to malfunction

Review the Wireshark reading from step 2, then write your analysis in section two of the Cybersecurity incident report template provided.

When writing your report, discuss the network devices and activities that are involved in the interruption. Include the following information in your explanation:

- Describe the attack. What are the main symptoms or characteristics of this specific type of attack?
- Explain how it affected the organization’s network. How does this specific network attack affect the website and how it functions?
- Describe the potential consequences of this attack and how it negatively affects the organization.
- Optional: Suggest potential ways to secure the network so this attack can be prevented in the future.

### Pro Tip: Save the template

You can save a blank copy of the template you used to complete this activity for further practice or in your professional projects. These templates will help you work through your thought processes and demonstrate your experience to potential employers.

### What to Include in Your Response

Be sure to address the following in your completed activity:

- The name of the network intrusion attack
- A description of how the attack negatively impacts network performance

## Activity Exemplar

- [Cybersecurity incident report exemplar]()

Compare the exemplar to your completed activity. Review your work using each of the criteria in the exemplar. What did you do well? Where can you improve? Use your answers to these questions to guide you as you continue to progress through the course.

**Note**: The exemplar represents one possible explanation for the issues that the user is facing. Yours will likely differ in certain ways. What’s important is that you identified the network protocols involved and created a report. In your role as a security analyst, you and your team would make a best guess about what happened and then investigate further to troubleshoot the issue and strengthen the overall security of your network.

The exemplar identifies that the connection timeout message is a result of a DoS attack. In this instance, the specific DoS attack is a SYN flood attack.

To determine this, analyze the data presented in the log file excerpt attached to this activity. Next, reflect on your current understanding of network attacks to identify what type of attack is occurring based on the data available.

After identifying a possible network attack type, proceed to explain how we came to identify the attack. Then, document how this specific type of attack might have affected the network and include a general description of how the attacker exploited the network vulnerability.

Lastly, describe how this attack resulted in the webpage displaying the connection timeout error.

The exemplar only provides one example of an explanation for the event. Describing an event typically requires presenting your evidence and explaining how you came to your decision. All patterns you notice in the logs and data are critical in determining the source and the type of network attack. The more practice you have identifying these patterns, the easier it will be to spot network attacks as they are occurring. This will allow you to respond to incidents more quickly and efficiently.
