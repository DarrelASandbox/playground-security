# Functions and variables

- [The Python Standard Library documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html)
- [Reference guide: Python concepts from module 2](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19kQXJP2L5P4_jBOhW8D9IyA4ewaQj1QWv1-Lp2HL0YU/template/preview?resourcekey=0-fcyLEIA6lINwqu6dTvTM0g#heading=h.6eikvmfmqupl)

```py
def display_investigation_message():
    print("investigate activity")

application_status = "potential concern"
email_status = "okay"

if application_status == "potential concern":
    print("application_log:")
    display_investigation_message()

if email_status == "potential concern":
    print("email log:")
```

## Working with variables in functions

```py
def remaining_login_attempts(maximum_attempts, total_attempts):
    return maximum_attempts - total_attempts
remaining_attempts = remaining_login_attempts(3, 3)
if remaining_attempts <= 0:
    print("Your account is locked")
```

### Parameter

A **parameter** is an object that is included in a function definition for use in that function. When you define a function, you create variables in the function header.

This function takes in two variables, `maximum_attempts` and `total_attempts` and uses them to perform a calculation. In this example, `maximum_attempts` and `total_attempts` are **parameters**.

### Argument

An **argument** is the data brought into a function when it is called.

When calling `remaining_login_attempts` in the following example, the integers `3` and `2` are considered **arguments**:

`remaining_login_attempts(3, 2)`

### `return`

The `return` keyword is used to return information from a function.

In the following example, it is before the calculation of how many login attempts remain:

```py
def remaining_login_attempts(maximum_attempts, total_attempts):
    return maximum_attempts - total_attempts
```

## Global and local variables

If you reuse the name of a global variable within a function, it will create a new local variable with that name. In other words, there will be both a global variable with that name and a local variable with that name, and they'll have different values.

```py
username = "elarson"
print("1:" + username)
def greet():
    username = "bmoreno"
    print("2:" + username)
greet()
print("3:" + username)

# 1:elarson
# 2:bmoreno
# 3:elarson
```

### Global variables

A **global variable** is a variable that is available through the entire program. Global variables are assigned outside of a function definition. Whenever that variable is called, whether inside or outside a function, it will return the value it is assigned.

### Local variables

A **local variable** is a variable assigned within a function. These variables cannot be called or accessed outside of the body of a function. Local variables include parameters as well as other variables assigned within a function definition.

# Built-in functions

## `print()`, `type()`

`print(type("This is a string"))`

## `max()` and `min()`

```py
time_list = [12, 2, 32, 19, 57, 22, 14]
print(min(time_list))
print(max(time_list))
```

## `sorted()`

```py
time_list = [12, 2, 32, 19, 57, 22, 14]
print(sorted(time_list))
print(time_list)
```

# `analyze_logins` function

```py
# Define a function named `analyze_logins()` that takes in three parameters, `username`, `current_day_logins`, and `average_day_logins`

def analyze_logins(username, current_day_logins, average_day_logins):
    print("Current day login total for", username, "is", current_day_logins)
    print("Average logins per day for", username, "is", average_day_logins)
    # Calculate the ratio of the logins made on the current day to the logins made on an average day, storing in a variable named `login_ratio`
    login_ratio = current_day_logins / average_day_logins
    return login_ratio

login_analysis = analyze_logins("ejones", 9, 3)
if login_analysis >= 3:
    print("Alert! This account has more login activity than normal.")
```

# Import modules and libraries in Python

A **module** is a Python file that contains additional functions, variables, classes, and any kind of runnable code.

A **library** is a collection of modules that provide code users can access in their programs.

## Importing an entire Python Standard Library module

```py
import statistics
monthly_failed_attempts = [20, 17, 178, 33, 15, 21, 19, 29, 32, 15, 25, 19]
median_failed_attempts = statistics.median(monthly_failed_attempts)
print("median:", median_failed_attempts)
```

## Importing specific functions from a module

```py
from statistics import mean, median
monthly_failed_attempts = [20, 17, 178, 33, 15, 21, 19, 29, 32, 15, 25, 19]
mean_failed_attempts = mean(monthly_failed_attempts)
print("mean:", mean_failed_attempts)
median_failed_attempts = median(monthly_failed_attempts)
print("median:", median_failed_attempts)
```

## External libraries

```py
# pip install numpy
import numpy
```

# Ensure proper syntax and readability

[PEP 8 - Style Guide for Python Code](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/)

## Comments

According to the PEP 8 style guide, itâ€™s best practice to keep all lines in Python under 79 characters to maintain readability, and this includes comments.

**Single-line comments** in Python begin with the (#) symbol.

**Multi-line comments** are used when you need more than 79 characters in a single comment.

Another way of writing multi-line comments is by using documentation strings and not assigning them to a variable. Documentation strings, also called docstrings, are strings that are written over multiple lines and are used to document code. To create a documentation string, use triple quotation marks (`""" """`).

The PEP 8 style guide recommends that indentations should be **four spaces** long.
