# Create or update a resume

## Activity Overview

In this activity, you will create a resume (1-2 pages) that is tailored to a role in cybersecurity.

A **resume** is a document that you create and use to present your background, skills, and accomplishments to potential employers when applying for jobs. To review the importance of building a professional portfolio and options for creating your portfolio, read [Create a cybersecurity portfolio](https://www.coursera.org/learn/prepare-for-cybersecurity-jobs/resources/ekICQ).

Be sure to complete this activity and answer the questions that follow before moving on. The next course item will provide you with a completed exemplar to compare to your own work.

## Scenario

Your resume gives potential employers a first impression of you and your qualifications. To prepare for your search for roles in cybersecurity, you will need to create a new resume or update your current one to reflect the skills and experiences you have gained from this program. First, you will search for and identify a target role. Then, as you craft your resume, you will tailor the content to match the requirements for that role.

**Note**: Crafting a strong resume is challenging and can take some time. For now, you should at least complete steps 1-6 of the activity, but feel free to finish the remainder of the steps later if you need more time. You will need to finish steps 1-9 to answer all of the questions at the end of this activity.

## Step-By-Step Instructions

Follow the instructions to complete each step of the activity. Then, answer the 5 questions at the end of the activity before going to the next course item to compare your work to a completed exemplar.

### Step 1: Select a resume template

The formatting elements provided in a template—such as the layout and headings—are a helpful starting point when creating a new resume.

To select a template for your resume, open the [template gallery](https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/?ftv=1&tgif=c) in Google Docs or another word processing application. Go to the resumes section and examine the templates. Choose one template for your **resume**, and open it. Rename the document “Resume [Your Name].”

Alternatively, if you already have a resume that you’d like to update, open that document instead.

### Step 2: Research cybersecurity roles

Think about what you’ve learned about cybersecurity roles in this program so far, and decide which type of role you would like to pursue. Consider the tasks and responsibilities that interest you, your current skill set, and your previous experience. Then, research roles on platforms like [Indeed](https://www.indeed.com/), [LinkedIn™ Job Search](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/), and/or [CareerBuilder](https://www.careerbuilder.com/) , and identify a position that appeals to you.

### Step 3: Take notes on your research

Add a blank page to the bottom of your resume document, or open a new document to take notes on your findings. Then, record the job title of the role you selected from your search, as well as some of the qualifications and skills required for that position. Read several additional job descriptions for similar roles to identify qualifications and skills that show up frequently, and note those as well.

### Step 4: Add your contact information

In the resume, add your contact information at the top of the document. Include the following information:

- Your name
- Location (such as city and state)
- Phone number
- Email address
- (Optional) the URL to your LinkedIn profile

Next, add a **job title** near your contact information that conveys both your current experience and the role you are seeking. For example, you might add “Incident Response Analyst” or “Data Forensics Analyst.” You can also add something more broad, such as “Cybersecurity Analyst.”

**Pro tip**: Your email address should be easy to read, relatively short. It should also avoid too many words or symbols that are unrelated to your name. You may need to create a new email address if your current one doesn't fit these requirements.

### Step 5: Add your skills

Review the notes you took in **Step 3** to help you fill in the **Skills** section of your resume. Include skills that align closely with the requirements for the position you identified. These might include skills you've learned in this program or ones you've gained in previous positions, such as:

- Python and data logging
- Communicating with stakeholders
- Attention to detail

To organize this section, format your skills as a bulleted list in two or more columns. You can also split different types of skills into different sections, based on the requirements of the role.

**Pro tip**: Match the language that was used by the potential employer when possible since some employers use automation software to filter resumes. For example, if the job description uses words like “problem-solving” and “critical thinking,” use those words in your resume, too.

### Step 6: Add your experience

The **Experience** section of your resume provides a summary of the positions you have held in your career. List **at least three** positions in reverse chronological order. This can include volunteer roles and other relevant experience. Each listing should include:

- Company name
- Location
- Job title
- Dates you worked there. (If you are still working there, write your start date, a hyphen, and then “Present.”)
- A short description or bulleted list of your responsibilities

Focus on showcasing only your best and most relevant responsibilities or accomplishments. Your resume doesn’t need to include every detail from every job you've held. Once you get an interview, you can go into more details about yourself.

Follow these best practices when adding to your Experience descriptions:

- Use active verbs like developed, coordinated, created, planned, built, tracked, managed, and monitored to describe the tasks you performed.
- When possible, quantify the tasks you performed by including numbers. (For example, “Collaborate with over 10 departments to ensure synchronization across the organization.”)
- Write in the present tense for work you still do, and use the past tense for a job or project that you completed.
- Aim to communicate how your skills and past accomplishments relate to the role you are applying for.

### Step 7: Add your education

The **Education** section of your resume describes any formal schooling and training you’ve had. Listing your education helps demonstrate the qualifications and knowledge you bring to a potential employer and shows that you meet the requirements for the opportunity you are seeking.

Fill in the name of any school you attended after high school; its location; the degree, diploma, or certificate you earned; and the dates that you attended. Begin with your most recent school first. Also, include any internships, apprenticeships, professional certifications, or credentials you hold. For example, you might include:

**Google Career Certificate in Cybersecurity** - Online certificate

MAY 20XX - OCTOBER 20XX

**Note**: If you’re currently enrolled in school and have not yet earned a degree or certification, write “In Progress” instead of the end date.

### Step 8: Add what makes you unique

Complete your resume with a section that further makes you stand out to potential employers. There are many approaches to communicating what makes you unique from other applicants.

For example, you can keep the existing **Awards** section (if using a Google Docs resume template) and list any awards you have received. Similar to the formatting used in Step 7, include who awarded them to you, and the date you received them.

Alternatively, you can replace this section with a section like “Languages,” “Software,” “Volunteer Work,” “Projects,” “Hobbies and Interests,” or “Accomplishments.”

**Pro tip**: Tailor the section whenever possible to match unique characteristics of the role. For example, if the employer is seeking someone who is multilingual and you speak several languages, add a “Languages" section to highlight your skills.

### Step 9: Proofread your resume

It's critical to carefully proofread your resume for spelling, grammatical, and punctuation errors. Correcting any mistakes demonstrates your attention to detail.

Make sure your resume is as concise as possible. Ideally, the length of your resume should be no more than one or two pages, particularly early on in your career. If there are places where you can use fewer words to say the same thing, choose a more precise word or concise phrasing.

**Pro tip**: Closely read every section yourself or ask a friend to review your resume and provide feedback. Spelling and grammar checking tools are helpful, but they can miss mistakes.

#### Pro Tip: Save a copy of your work

Finally, be sure to save a copy of your completed resume. You can use it for your professional portfolio to demonstrate your knowledge and/or experience to potential employers.

**Note**: If you added a blank page in your resume document in **Step 3** to take notes, be sure to delete that page now.

#### What to Include in Your Response

Be sure to address the following elements in your completed resume:

- Include your **contact information** at the top of your resume.
- List the **skills** you have that align most closely to the job posting.
- Detail your **work experience**, including each company name, location, your job title, the dates you worked there, and a description of your responsibilities.
- Detail your **education**, such as the name of the institution, its location, the credential you earned, and the dates you attended.
- List any **unique skills**, such as awards or other professional highlights.
- Use correct grammar, spelling, and punctuation.
- Be **1-2** pages long.

### Step 10: Assess your completed resume

The following is a self-assessment for your resume. You will use these statements to review your own work. This self-assessment process is an important part of the learning experience because it allows you to objectively assess your resume.

There are a total of 5 points possible for this activity and each statement is worth 1 point. The items correspond to each step you completed for the activity.

To complete the self-assessment, first open your resume. Then respond yes or no to each statement.

When you complete and submit your responses, you will receive a percentage score. This score will help you confirm whether you completed the required steps of the activity. The recommended passing grade for this project is at least 80% (or 4/5 points). If you want to increase your score, you can revise your project and then resubmit your responses to reflect any changes you made. Try to achieve at least 4 points before continuing on to the next course item.

## Activity Exemplar

Link to exemplar: [Sample resume](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iaji5Llc0lemWic3FeRbYKwz-hUkDhKQNkG6Qsb0kZs/template/preview?resourcekey=0-posEb7jn6SM2bvh4U1UP2g#heading=h.inx73jfg7qti)

Compare the exemplar to your completed resume. Review your work using each of the criteria in the exemplar. What did you do well? Where can you improve? Use your answers to these questions to guide you as you continue to progress through the certificate program.

**Note**: The exemplar represents one possible way to complete a resume. Yours will likely differ in certain ways. What’s important is that your resume explains your strengths, values, and interest in the cybersecurity profession.

# The interview process

## Getting contacted by a recruiter

After you apply for a job, you might receive a call, an email, or a message from a recruiter expressing interest in your application and asking to schedule a call or meeting. Reply as soon as possible to show that you’re responsive and interested in the position.

## Preliminary interview or phone screening

In most cases, the first step in the interview process is a preliminary interview, sometimes referred to as a phone screening. This usually involves a conversation with a recruiter over the phone, in person, or on a video call.

The preliminary interview is typically shorter than a regular interview. The recruiter will share information about the company and the job opening. Then they’ll ask you questions to get to know you and your work experience better. The recruiter will also provide time for you to ask questions about the role and the company, so be sure to prepare a few questions before the interview. For example, you might ask: “What is the work culture like at the company?” or “What will my average day be like in this role?” Asking questions helps demonstrate your interest and will help you determine whether the job will be a good fit for you.

After the interview, send a thank-you email to the recruiter within 24 hours. Express your gratitude for their time and briefly restate why you would be a good fit for the position.

## Additional interviews

Once you’ve passed the preliminary interview, you might be invited for multiple additional interviews. These interviews are typically with the hiring manager. You might also meet with other individuals on the team and be required to go through a technical interview. You’ll learn more about technical interviews in a later reading.

This interview is often longer than the preliminary interview. It could be in person, over the phone, or on a video call.

The interview usually opens with introductions and a brief description of the company and job position. Then, the interviewer will ask you questions about your background, skills, and experience. Next, you’ll have an opportunity to ask questions about the company, the role, and job expectations.

Finally, you’ll learn about next steps in the hiring process.

There might be multiple rounds of interviews, depending on how the company’s interview process works. These additional interviews could be longer, include future teammates or other employees at the company, and feature questions that take more time and thought to answer.

As with the preliminary interview, send a thank-you note to the people you interviewed with after each round of interviews.

## Final offer

Now comes the exciting part: Receiving a job offer. The company might reach out to you by phone or email. After the company extends their initial offer, you’ll need to decide whether or not to accept it or negotiate for a higher salary or other benefits. Feel free to ask for a day or two to make your decision.

## Building perseverance

If the company lets you know that you didn’t get the job, take a moment to process your emotions. If you’d like, you can let the company know that you appreciate the opportunity to be considered and that you’d be interested in any future roles that might be a good fit. You can also ask for feedback on what you could do better next time.

# How to Build Rapport with Your Potential Employer

Building rapport with a potential employer is a critical skill that can significantly enhance your chances of success during the interview process. Rapport is a friendly relationship where individuals understand each other’s ideas and communicate effectively. This guide explores strategies to build rapport from the first interaction to post-interview follow-ups.

## Building Rapport from the First Interaction

- Initial Communication:
- Begin building rapport with the company staff during your first interaction via phone, email, or video conference.
- Use a professional yet polite and friendly tone in your emails.
- Express appreciation for being considered and the opportunity to interview.

## Engaging During the Interview

### Phone Screening

- Use a friendly and conversational tone during phone screenings.
- Smile while speaking, as it makes your tone sound friendlier, even though it cannot be seen.

### In-Person or Video Interviews

- Ease interview nervousness by engaging naturally:
- Start with a friendly greeting, e.g., “Hello, nice to meet you.”
- Initiate a short, light conversation, e.g., “How was your weekend?” or “How is your day going?”
- Make eye contact during in-person interviews or look directly into the camera during video interviews to show engagement.

### Asking Questions During the Interview

- Purpose of Asking Questions:
- Demonstrates engagement, interest in the role, and confidence.
- Helps assess if the company is a good fit for you.
- Sample Questions:

| What is the biggest challenge I might face in this r le, and how would I be expected to address it? | Shows your preparedness and willingness to tackle challenges. |
| What would you say is the best part about working for this company? | Indicates your interest in company culture. |
| What is a typical day like for an analyst? | Displays curiosity about the role’s day-to-day responsibilities. |
| What is the potential for growth in this role? | Reflects ambition and long-term interest in the position. |

## Follow-Up After the Interview

- Send a follow-up email within a day or two after the interview.
- Thank the interviewer for the opportunity to meet and learn more about the company.
- Mention something specific from the interview to show engagement in the conversation.
- Importance of Follow-Up:
- Sets you apart from other candidates.
- Reinforces the interviewer’s memory of your discussion.

# Prepare for technical interviews

## What are technical interviews?

After you’ve applied for a job in cybersecurity and receive interest from a recruiter, you might be invited to an introductory interview, a second interview with a hiring manager, and a panel interview. Additionally, you might be asked to participate in a technical interview. The main difference between technical interviews and other interviews is the focus on required knowledge of specific tools.

## Python

Python is a programming language that serves as an important tool in security, and you might be asked about it during a technical interview. It will be important to mention your basic knowledge of Python. You might recall from this program that Python is popular for its ease of use as well as its extensive libraries and integrations. It can be applied to various security tasks that require automation. During your interview, you might be asked to whiteboard a pseudo code in Python. Being able to confidently use Python terminology during an interview can help you stand out as a potential candidate. This will let the interviewer know that you have a solid understanding of what Python is and what it can be used for.

## General techniques

During your technical interview, you might be expected to demonstrate basic knowledge of various general security concepts. For example, you might need to show familiarity with **security frameworks**, which are guidelines used for building plans to help mitigate risk and threats to data and privacy. When discussing security frameworks, it would be helpful to mention your knowledge of specific NIST frameworks, such as the Cybersecurity Framework (CSF). Another technical concept for you to discuss during a technical interview is **network security**. You might recall that network security is the practice of keeping an organization’s network infrastructure secure from unauthorized access. Reviewing the different technical concepts you’ve learned throughout this program is a good way to prepare for a technical interview. It will sharpen your skills and help you leave a good impression on the interviewer.

Additionally, it may be a good idea to write the entire question down on paper before answering. Often, technical interview questions have multiple parts to cover. People sometimes rush to give an answer and show their knowledge but not fully cover everything that the question asks. Writing down the question can help you ensure you have the question right and are able to provide a structured response.

## Possible technical interview questions

Every technical interview will be different, depending on the company and the interviewers. But here are a few possible technical interview questions to help you prepare:

- What is the TCP/IP model?

The TCP/IP model is a framework used to visualize how data is organized and transmitted across a network.

- What is the OSI model?

The OSI model stands for open systems interconnection (OSI) model. It is a standardized concept that describes the seven layers computers use to communicate and send data over the network.

- What are SIEM tools and what are they used for?

SIEM tools are security information and event management tools that are used by security professionals to identify and analyze security threats, risks, and vulnerabilities.

# Apply the STAR method during interviews

When interviewing for a job, it can be challenging to convey the right details about your professional history and skills to your interviewers. Using the STAR method can help you share your success stories effectively and strategically. STAR stands for Situation, Task, Action, and Result. Using this method enables you to describe potential challenges you faced in previous roles and gives you the opportunity to show how you thoughtfully approached solving those problems from start to finish.

## Situation

The **situation** is the project you worked on or a challenge that you had to overcome. For example, perhaps you had to manage a disgruntled customer’s negative feedback about your company, a system error on your work device that slowed down a customer transaction, or being left alone in the office for an extended period of time. Fully describing the situation allows the interviewer to gain a clear understanding of the challenge you had to overcome.

## Task

The **task** outlines the key responsibilities or role you played in solving the challenge described in the situation phase of the STAR method. Specifying what the task is provides clarity about what your objectives were in this scenario.

## Action

The **action** describes the exact steps you took to resolve the challenging situation you described in the beginning of the STAR method. The action is crucial to the STAR method because it allows the employer to understand what choices you made to achieve your desired outcome during a real conflict or challenge. Employers want employees who can think fast and make decisions that help solve problems.

## Result

Finally, sharing the **result** of your challenge or example shows the employers how the situation was resolved as a direct result of the actions you took. When participating in an interview, you want to make sure that any example you give with the STAR method ends in a positive result. Positive results show an employer that you are someone who has demonstrated an ability to successfully resolve issues and may lead an employer to offer you a job. Of course, not all situations have completely positive outcomes; if an employer asks you about a situation that didn’t have a positive outcome, try to focus on what you learned from the situation and how that experience helped you become a better employee.

# Use the STAR method to answer interview questions

## Activity Overview

In this activity, you will answer two common **behavioral interview questions** using the STAR method.

As you've learned, the STAR method is a helpful strategy for answering behavioral interview questions in a clear, organized, and engaging way. STAR stands for “situation,” “task,” “action,” and “result.” In an interview, you may be asked behavioral interview questions. These types of questions require you to share a time when you were faced with a particular situation or had to practice a certain skill.

Be sure to complete this activity before moving on. The next course item will provide you with a completed exemplar to compare to your own work.

## Scenario

Review the following information. Then complete the step-by-step instructions.

When you use the STAR method to answer behavioral interview questions during an interview, interviewers get a better sense of who you are as a candidate and why you’ve applied for the role. The STAR method can make your responses easier for them to follow by creating a logical structure to each story you share. Preparing and practicing responses using the STAR method in advance can also help you feel more confident going into an interview.

In this activity, you will prepare responses to two common behavioral interview questions. First, you will recall and record notes about experiences you’ve had in the past that demonstrate your key skills. Then, you will select two questions from a list of behavioral questions frequently asked during interviews. You will answer each of these questions using the STAR method. Finally, you have the option to practice answering these questions and others aloud in front of a mirror, friend, or family member.

# Prepare for interviews

## Prepare for the introductory call

It’s important to showcase your best self in the introductory phone call. In this conversation, you’ll talk with the recruiter or hiring manager about yourself, the kind of work or training you have, and why you want the job. You might also be asked specifically about your salary requirements. For this question, it’s a good idea to prepare in advance and conduct an internet search for “average salary for entry-level security analysts.”

### Do your research

Make sure you’ve done your research on the company. When the interviewer asks why you’d be a good fit for the job, they want to learn why you’re interested in cybersecurity and why you want to work at that company specifically.

## Prepare for the second round

Your second-round interview will focus more on what you can offer as an entry-level security analyst. You’ll likely discuss yourself here, too, but you’ll also be going into detail about your knowledge of the profession. You’ll want to cover the same material you prepared for your introductory call, but you’ll also need to fully review your accomplishments in the security industry. Don’t worry if you have no prior professional cybersecurity experience. You can discuss the information you’ve learned in this certificate program.

Depending on where you and your interviewer are located, the second-round interview might be over the phone, via video conference, or in person. In-person interviews often last an hour or so, but if you traveled for your interview or the company likes to bring candidates in for all of the remaining interview stages at once, you might complete your panel interview with a group that day as well.

### Panel interview

During the panel interview, you’ll meet with two or more people and discuss yourself and your ability to contribute to the organization. If you’re nervous about this, remind yourself that the team brought you in for the interview for a reason. When you feel confident in your abilities, you’re better able to showcase your knowledge about the security industry and demonstrate your ability to work well with a team.

Be sure to engage with each panelist by giving them your full attention during the interview. Maintaining eye contact can help you express confidence, but for those who cannot do so, actively engaging with each panelist in your own way is just as important.

It’s likely that each panelist will ask you at least one question during the interview. It’s okay to address the whole panel when answering a question, rather than only directing your response to the person who asked the question.

# Learn more about developing an elevator pitch

When interviewing with potential employers, it’s important to communicate who you are, your value as a security professional, and what qualities you’re searching for in a potential job. A simple way to deliver this information succinctly is with an **elevator pitch**. An elevator pitch is a brief summary of your experience, skills, and background that should be communicated in 60 seconds or fewer.

Although an elevator pitch is often specific to an idea or a product, you can also use it to sell yourself as a professional to potential employers. In an interview, a strong elevator pitch can be used to stand out to your interviewer. It can be used to help explain why you’re a good fit for the role or to answer the popular interview question “tell me about yourself.” This reading helps you prepare your elevator pitch to express the value you can provide as an entry-level security analyst or a more experienced cybersecurity professional.

## Provide an introduction

Start by providing an introduction. Introduce yourself and give a brief overview of your professional background. Explain some job roles you’ve had, your years of work experience, and the types of industries you’ve worked in. If this is your first job in security, mention some of your past roles and skills used for those roles that can translate to success in the security field. Some of these skills can include attention to detail, goal-orientedness, and good collaboration skills.

## Describe your career interests and transferable skills

Even if you’re interviewing for your first internship or job in security, it’s important to clarify that this is your desired career. For example, you could say, “I want to apply my excellent skills for collaborating with others, and my attention to detail, to help the security team protect company data and assets.” To determine which transferable skills to highlight in your elevator pitch, consider ones that you have already developed and how they might apply to your goals as a security professional, such as problem-solving, communication, and time management.

## Express your excitement

This is where you share your passion for the field and why you want to work in the industry. If you’re motivated to help an organization defend itself against hackers, mention that. This is also a good time to talk about your goals.

For example, you could say, “I love security because it gives me the opportunity to safeguard valuable information from malicious actors attempting to cause unnecessary harm to people and organizations. Long term, I’d love to develop a security and hacker mindset to play my part in defending against the constantly evolving threat actor tactics and techniques.”

## Communicate your interest in the company

Communicating why you are interested in the company—and not just the role—is a great way to help the interviewer recognize that you are knowledgeable about the company. This helps you to establish a rapport with the interviewer and shows that you’ve done your due diligence before coming to the interview.

For example, if you were interviewing for a position for Google’s security team, you could say, “Being a member of Google’s security team helps protect millions of people’s private and sensitive information. As a long-time Google products user, I’m looking forward to the opportunity to be able to help safeguard those products and ensure customers have the best experience possible.”

# Draft an elevator pitch

## Activity Overview

In this activity, you will research cybersecurity roles on a job search website and record notes on a position that interests you. Then, you will practice preparing to interview for that role by writing an elevator pitch.

An elevator pitch is a short, memorable description that explains a concept in an easy-to-understand way. Elevator pitches are helpful for introducing yourself to career and business connections. They can be used in formal and informal ways. For example, meeting another security practitioner at an industry event or during a job interview.

Be sure to complete this activity before moving on. The next course item will provide you with a completed exemplar to compare to your own work.

## Scenario

Review the scenario below. Then complete the step-by-step instructions.

To create a strong elevator pitch, you need to consider how to present yourself as a suitable candidate for a specific role. Before you begin writing your pitch, you will determine what industry benefits you are looking for in a cybersecurity role. Then, you will research relevant roles on a job search website and identify one that appeals to you. Next, you will review the job description for the position and record key information about your relevant experience, skills, and details about the company. After, you will write a 30- to 60-second elevator pitch using that information. Your elevator pitch will focus on describing yourself, your professional experience and skills, and why you are an ideal candidate for the role.

**Note**: While this is a practice exercise and you won’t actually be applying for the role you’ve identified (unless you choose to), you can implement this process to search for relevant roles and draft corresponding elevator pitches in the future.

## Step-By-Step Instructions

Add **at least 1 note** on these criteria to the **Job Search Criteria** section of the elevator pitch template.

### Step 3: Identify your target role

For your elevator pitch to be most effective, you’ll need to tailor it to each position you apply for. Begin by searching for roles on platforms like [indeed.com](https://www.indeed.com/), [linkedin.com/jobs](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/), or [careerbuilder.com](https://www.careerbuilder.com/). You can search for cybersecurity titles like, but not limited to, Security Analyst, Information Security Analyst or SOC Analyst.

**Pro tip**: You can also use the criteria you noted in the **Job Search Criteria** section of the elevator pitch template to filter for specific jobs.

When you identify a role that appeals to you, add its title and the company’s name to the Role section of the elevator pitch template.

### Step 4: Record your relevant experience and skills

Review the job description for the role you identified in Step 2. Think about how the experience, responsibilities, and skills required for the position align with your own experience and skill set.

Consider experience or skills you gained from previous jobs, school, this program, volunteer work, and even your personal life. Record **at least 2-3** relevant experiences and skills in the **Relevant Experience and Skills** section of the template.

### Step 5: Record information about the company

Describe what they do and what their mission is. You may find this information in the job description itself, or you might need to navigate to the company’s website. Read what others have to say about the company, as well.Conduct some pre-interview research about the company that is hiring for the role that you identified.

Consider the following details while reviewing their information:

- What's their mission?
- What industry are they in?
- Are they a new company?

You might find this information in the job description itself. Then, record **2-3 sentences (40-60 words)** describing your findings in the **Company Description** section of the template. Note anything about the company that you find particularly interesting.

### Step 6: Start your pitch with an introduction

In the steps that follow, you'll draft an elevator pitch in the **Elevator Pitch** section of the template.

Start with an introduction of **2-3 sentences (40-60 words)** that includes your name and provides a brief overview of your professional background. Explain some job roles you’ve had, your years of work experience, and the types of industries you’ve worked in. If this is your first job in cybersecurity, mention some of your previous jobs that had relatable or transferable skills.

### Step 7: Express your interest in the role

In an elevator pitch, it’s important to get to the point as quickly as possible. Write **1-2 sentences (20-40 words)** explaining why the role interests you and why you want to work in the industry.

### Step 8: Describe your relevant experience and skills

Next, review the relevant experience and skills you recorded in Step 3. In **2-4 sentences (40-80 words)**, highlight your experience and skills to communicate the value you would bring to the position. Describe the strengths you have that make you a good fit for the role. Consider mentioning your completion of this certificate program and other relevant coursework. And, if applicable, describe a particular project you worked on that relates to the requirements for the role.

### Step 9: Communicate your interest in the company

Communicating why you are interested in the company helps show the interviewer that you are knowledgeable about the company and not just the role. Refer to the description of the company you recorded in Step 3. Then, write **1-2 sentences (20-40 words)** indicating that you understand the company’s mission and expressing your desire to work for them.

### Step 10: Proofread and revise your draft

Once you’re done with your first draft, proofread and revise it. Set a timer and read your draft out loud to check if it fits within the 30–60 second limit. While checking to see it fits within that time frame, it’s also important not to talk too quickly. Talking too fast can make your elevator pitch hard to understand. If necessary, edit it down. Remember, you want to be able to quickly deliver your elevator pitch and capture your audience’s attention. Reading your pitch out loud can also help you identify any awkward phrasing and refine your writing.

## Pro Tip: Save your work

Finally, be sure to save the work you did to complete this activity. This can help you work through your thought processes and demonstrate your experience to potential employers.

# Tips for interviewing remotely

A remote interview is an interview conducted virtually using video platform software. This type of interview provides an opportunity to connect with hiring managers and recruiters, even if you are not able to meet with them in person. Remote interviews also present challenges that in-person interviews do not, such as issues related to technology, lighting, and sound.

## Test your technology

The first tip is to test the technology you’ll be using for the video. Different companies use different video platform software to host their remote interviews. Typically, the recruiter or hiring manager will reach out to you over the phone or email to share information about which software will be used for the interview.

Once you find out which software the company you’re interviewing with uses, you should download that software, if you don't have it already. Next, it's important to test your computer’s camera and microphone to ensure they work well with the video platform software a day or two before the interview. This allows you to resolve any technical issues you might have. Be mindful of how to mute and unmute your microphone, just in case there is noise in your environment that you do not want the interviewer to hear. It’s also important to talk with the recruiter or hiring manager about a backup plan if the technology does not cooperate when it's time for the interview.

You’ll also want to test any technologies you need to use to ensure you are ready to interview, such as the closed caption feature on the app. Employers are typically happy to accommodate your needs if you're using assistive technology or need specific accommodations. If your internet service is not fast enough to allow for a video interview, you can request a phone interview instead.

## Practice communicating through video

Communicating through video can be a challenge because there is a slight sound delay. The sound delay can make it difficult to know how long to wait for someone to stop speaking and for you to start. If you don’t have experience communicating through video, consider practicing with friends and family before the remote interview. This will help you learn how pauses affect video communication.

## Create a professional background

Review your video background before the interview. Typically, you should avoid having an unorganized background or any objects that might distract the interviewer. When interviewing remotely, ensure that your area is well lit. You might want to rearrange your desk or furniture to ensure good lighting.

Always try to have light behind your camera so that it will shine on your face. If you can’t position your desk next to a window or don’t have enough light coming from the window, consider using artificial light.

Additionally, you should do your best to limit background noise and use a headset, if possible.

## Dress appropriately

It’s a good idea to research the company you’re interviewing with to determine which type of interview outfit is suitable. You might need to wear formal business attire during your remote interview for a particular role and company, whereas for another position, more casual clothing might be appropriate. Typically, it is better to overdress than to underdress, especially for more traditional businesses.

## Look at the interviewer when speaking

When communicating through video, try to look at the interviewer when speaking instead of at the camera. Looking at the interviewer can give them the feeling that you’re engaged in the conversation and focused on what they’re saying.

## Sign in early

Before the interview, test your technology. This will help you feel confident that everything will work. However, technology and software can be unpredictable. If possible, sign in to your remote interview early to ensure everything is working properly.

Signing in early also indicates to your interviewer that you respect their time and are a punctual person.

# Use generative AI to work smarter and faster

In the introductory reading you learned that AI refers to computer programs that can complete cognitive tasks typically associated with human intelligence. One specific type of AI is **generative AI (gen AI)**, which is AI that can generate new content, like text, images, or other media. [Gemini](http://gemini.google.com/), [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) by OpenAI, and [Microsoft Copilot](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-copilot/) are examples of generative AI tools. You can interact with a generative AI tool by entering a prompt, which is input that provides instructions to an AI tool about how to generate output. The tool then creates new content based on that prompt.

In your work as a cybersecurity professional, you can leverage generative AI tools to help you complete both practical and creative tasks. Consider these applications of generative AI tools that can help you work more efficiently and effectively:

- **Create content**: You can use generative AI tools to generate text, images, and other media. For example, you might create a large set of fake data to test the cybersecurity tools your organization uses.
- **Analyze information quickly**; Generative AI tools can analyze large amounts of content quickly. For example, you might use generative AI to summarize reports or meeting transcripts that contain important information related to the security of your organization, helping you identify key details quicker.
- **Answer questions in detailed and nuanced ways**: Generative AI is effective at summarizing information, which makes it useful for research. For example, you can prompt a generative AI tool to provide you with information about common types of cybersecurity threats, such as malware and ransomware.
- **Simplify day-to-day work**: You can also use generative AI to augment routine tasks. For example, AI tools can quickly provide an initial analysis of whether an email is likely to be malicious.

In the upcoming series of videos you will be introduced to Luis, a cybersecurity professional working at Google. Luis will introduce you to the ways that he incorporates AI into his daily workflows to do things like check code, understand system vulnerabilities, and more.

The ways you might use generative AI in your work will likely go beyond these examples as the capabilities of AI tools expand, and as you continue your own development as a cybersecurity professional.

# Use generative AI to list common signs of phishing and malware

## Introduction

## Activity details

Imagine you’re working as a cybersecurity professional. Recently, employees at your company have complained about receiving a number of phishing emails that attempt to trick them into revealing sensitive information.

Your manager asks you to train the team to better identify phishing emails and signs of malware, so you decide to create a reference guide. To get started, you ask a generative AI tool to create a first draft.

As a reminder, here is the prompting framework:

- **T**houghtfully: Describe the **task**, specifying a persona and format preference.
- **C**reate: Include any **context** the gen AI tool might need to give you what you want.
- **R**eally: Add **references** the gen AI tool can use to inform its output.
- **E**xcellent: Next, **evaluate** the output to identify opportunities for improvement.
- **I**nputs: Then, **iterate** on your initial prompt to attain those improvements.

In this activity, you’ll start prompting with just one part of the framework, then gradually build on it in order to identify what’s missing or unhelpful from your prompt and make the output more useful.

## Step-By-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Enter your initial prompt

Let's start by entering a simple prompt into the generative AI tool, focusing solely on the **task** at hand. We'll refine and expand this prompt using the rest of the prompting framework in subsequent steps. For now, consider this example prompt that outlines what we want the tool to do:

**PROMPT**: Write a reference guide on phishing emails and malware.

Remember, this initial prompt is a starting point for learning and experimentation. We'll iterate on it later to ensure it aligns with the prompting framework and produces the best possible results.

### Step 2: Evaluate the initial output

Review and assess the output from your initial prompt. Is the reference guide accurate and unbiased? Does it include all the necessary information? Is it written in an appropriate tone? Will users across the organization understand the guide if you choose to share it with them?

Identify ways that the output could better meet your needs, and use this assessment to guide your refinement and iteration process.

### Step 3: Revise and refine your prompt

Revise and refine your prompt by adding more of the prompting framework:

- Add more context to your initial prompt to help the tool provide better, more relevant results.
  - For example you could:
    - Ask that the reference guide be more comprehensive.
    - Give feedback on the tone you’d like to maintain.
    - Identify your audience (are they technical or non-technical employees?).
    - Request that the guide include examples of common tactics used in phishing emails or a list of signs that a computer may be infected with malware.
    - Focus on any accessibility considerations.
- Provide examples as **references**.
  - For example, in your prompt, you can provide a list of existing company policies or guidelines related to cybersecurity to ensure the guide aligns with these established practices.
- Specify the format you want to receive.
  - For example you could:
    - Set a word or character limit.
    - Ask that the guide be made more visually appealing.
    - Request that it be broken up into bullet points.
    - Instruct that there be placeholders for any images you may want to include.

Now, enter your revised prompt or continue the dialogue with the AI tool to build on your previous requests.

### Step 4: Evaluate the output again

Review the output again and assess what information you might still need. Are there any other parts of the prompting framework that you can include next time, or opportunities to add more detail or nuance? If so, continue to prompt.

### Step 5: Take an iterative approach

Continue repeating steps 3 and 4 until you feel confident that the output meets your goals. For example, is the guide relevant and complete? Is it written in language that users across your organization, including those with limited technical expertise, will understand?

This exercise, along with the lesson videos, offer examples of how generative AI can streamline your daily tasks. Now, experiment with your preferred generative AI tool to discover how it can support your specific responsibilities as a cybersecurity professional.

### Step 6: Questions and submission

Answer the following questions to complete the assignment.
